In these experiments it was frequently observed that rather than attempting to escape from plateaus by extensive search, it was better to completely restart from a new random initial state. The optimum point to terminate search and restart was determined empirically over a range of problem sizes and complexities. The growth rate of the optimum cutoff is faster than linear with the number of features, although the exact growth rate was not determined. Based on these empirical results, a simple run-time heuristic is proposed to determine when to give up searching a plateau and restart. This heuristic closely approximates the empirically determined optimum values over a range of problem sizes and complexities, and consequently allows the search algorithm to automatically adjust its strategy for each particular problem without prior knowledge of the problem's complexity.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

A case-based approach is used to generate hypotheses through incorrectly applying analogy, overgeneralization, and overspecialization. The student and expert models use a network-based representation that includes abstract concepts and relationships as well as strategies for problem solving.

In this paper we develop an approach to these problems based on the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of action to include options|whole courses of behavior that may be temporally extended, stochastic, and contingent on events. Examples of options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a distant city, as well as primitive actions such as muscle twitches and joint torques. Options may be given a priori, learned by experience, or both. They may be used interchangeably with actions in a variety of planning and learning methods. The theory of semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs) can be applied to model the consequences of options and as a basis for planning and learning methods using them. In this paper we develop these connections, building on prior work by Bradtke and Duff (1995), Parr (in prep.) and others. Our main novel results concern the interface between the MDP and SMDP levels of analysis. We show how a set of options can be altered by changing only their termination conditions to improve over SMDP methods with no additional cost. We also introduce intra-option temporal-difference methods that are able to learn from fragments of an option's execution. Finally, we propose a notion of subgoal which can be used to improve the options themselves. Overall, we argue that options and their models provide hitherto missing aspects of a powerful, clear, and expressive framework for representing and organizing knowledge.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We argue that many decision tree and rule learning algorithms can be easily extended to set-valued features.

However, as emphasized by Schwartz (1993), in many problems, e.g., those for which the optimal behavior is a limit cycle, it is more natural and com-putationally advantageous to formulate tasks so that the controller's objective is to maximize the average payoff received per time step. In this paper I derive new average-payoff RL algorithms as stochastic approximation methods for solving the system of equations associated with the policy evaluation and optimal control questions in average-payoff RL tasks. These algorithms are analogous to the popular TD and Q-learning algorithms already developed for the discounted-payoff case.

Preference: Oral presentation Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Channel Allocation in: In cellular telephone systems, an important problem is to dynamically allocate the communication resource (channels) so as to maximize service in a stochastic caller environment. This problem is naturally formulated as a dynamic programming problem and we use a reinforcement learning (RL) method to find dynamic channel allocation policies that are better than previous heuristic solutions. The policies obtained perform well for a broad variety of call traffic patterns. We present results on a large cellular system In cellular communication systems, an important problem is to allocate the communication resource (bandwidth) so as to maximize the service provided to a set of mobile callers whose demand for service changes stochastically. A given geographical area is divided into mutually disjoint cells, and each cell serves the calls that are within its boundaries (see Figure 1a). The total system bandwidth is divided into channels, with each channel centered around a frequency. Each channel can be used simultaneously at different cells, provided these cells are sufficiently separated spatially, so that there is no interference between them. The minimum separation distance between simultaneous reuse of the same channel is called the channel reuse constraint . When a call requests service in a given cell either a free channel (one that does not violate the channel reuse constraint) may be assigned to the call, or else the call is blocked from the system; this will happen if no free channel can be found. Also, when a mobile caller crosses from one cell to another, the call is \"handed off\" to the cell of entry; that is, a new free channel is provided to the call at the new cell. If no such channel is available, the call must be dropped/disconnected from the system. One objective of a channel allocation policy is to allocate the available channels to calls so that the number of blocked calls is minimized. An additional objective is to minimize the number of calls that are dropped when they are handed off to a busy cell. These two objectives must be weighted appropriately to reflect their relative importance, since dropping existing calls is generally more undesirable than blocking new calls. with approximately 70 49 states.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

For both problems, GP+DSS with the small population size consistently produces a better answer using fewer tree evaluations than other runs using much larger populations. Even standard GP can be seen to perform well with the much smaller population size, indicating that it is certainly worth an exploratory run or three with a small population size before assuming that a large population size is necessary.

Each generation of the population of agents is placed into the Simulator with the ultimate goal of producing an agent capable of surviving any environment. The environment that an agent is presented consists of other agents, mines, and energy. The goal of this research is to construct a program which when executed will allow an agent (or agents) to correctly sense, and mark, the presence of items (energy and mines) in any environment. The Simulator determines the raw fitness of each agent by interpreting the associated program. General programs are evolved to solve this problem. Different environmental setups are presented to show the generality of the solution. These environments include one agent in a fixed environment, one agent in a fluctuating environment, and multiple agents in a fluctuating environment cooperating together.

Firstly, we extend inversion via backpropagation (Linden/Kindermann [4], Williams [11]) to recurrent (El-man [1], Jordan [3], Mozer [5], Williams/Zipser [10]), time-delayed (Waibel at al.

The corresponding output vector is equal to the target vector except a small remainder. The knowledge of those attractors may help to understand the function and the generalization qualities of connectionist systems of this kind. Secondly, we introduce a new inversion method for proving the non-existence of an input combination under special constraints, e.g. in a subspace of the input space. This method works by iterative exclusion of invalid activation values. It might be a helpful way to judge the properties of a trained network.

I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently-developed method of \"simulated tempering\", the \"tempered transition\" method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that unfortunately is cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are \"deceptive\".\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Neural Networks, : Technical Report CS-TR-3465 and UMIACS-TR-95-54 University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 Abstract The extraction of symbolic knowledge from trained neural networks and the direct encoding of (partial) knowledge into networks prior to training are important issues. They allow the exchange of information between symbolic and connectionist knowledge representations. The focus of this paper is on the quality of the rules that are extracted from recurrent neural networks. Discrete-time recurrent neural networks can be trained to correctly classify strings of a regular language. Rules defining the learned grammar can be extracted from networks in the form of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA's) by applying clustering algorithms in the output space of recurrent state neurons. Our algorithm can extract different finite-state automata that are consistent with a training set from the same network. We compare the generalization performances of these different models and the trained network and we introduce a heuristic that permits us to choose among the consistent DFA's the model which best approximates the learned regular grammar.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

One difficulty is that, in order to distinguish the target from distractors, a combination of features must be associated with a single object. Often called the binding problem, this requirement presents a serious hurdle for connectionist models of visual processing when multiple objects are present. Psychophysical experiments suggest that people use covert visual attention to get around this problem.

Despite being chosen by this heterogeneous approach, the uncertainty samples yielded classifiers with lower error rates than random samples ten times larger.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The resulting models have multiple state variables that are temporally coupled via matrices of conditional probabilities. We introduce a deterministic O(T (CN ) 2 ) approximation for maximum a posterior (MAP) state estimation which enables fast classification and parameter estimation via expectation maximization. An \"N-heads\" dynamic programming algorithm samples from the highest probability paths through a compact state trellis, minimizing an upper bound on the cross entropy with the full (combinatoric) dynamic programming problem. The complexity is O(T (CN ) 2 ) for C chains of N states apiece observing T data points, compared with O(T N 2C ) for naive (Cartesian product), exact (state clustering), and stochastic (Monte Carlo) methods applied to the same inference problem. In several experiments examining training time, model likelihoods, classification accuracy, and robustness to initial conditions, coupled hmms compared favorably with conventional hmms and with energy-based approaches to coupled inference chains. We demonstrate and compare these algorithms on synthetic and real data, including interpretation of video.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We discuss drawbacks with previous approaches to dealing with this problem, and present a new algorithm based on a multiresolution search of a quickly-constructible augmented kd-tree. Without needing to rebuild the tree, we can make fast predictions with arbitrary local weighting functions, arbitrary kernel widths and arbitrary queries. The paper begins with a new, faster, algorithm for exact LWPR predictions. Next we introduce an approximation that achieves up to a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup with negligible accuracy losses. Increasing a certain approximation parameter achieves greater speedups still, but with a correspondingly larger accuracy degradation. This is nevertheless useful during operations such as the early stages of model selection and locating optima of a fitted surface. We also show how the approximations can permit real-time query-specific optimization of the kernel width.

Therefore, they have to be trained off-line, and they cannot adapt to changing channel characteristics. In this paper, a novel dual reinforcement learning approach is proposed that can adapt on-line while the system is performing. Assuming that the channel characteristics are the same in both directions, two predistorters at each end of the communication channel co-adapt using the output of the other predistorter to determine their own reinforcement. Using the common Volterra Series model to simulate the channel, the system is shown to successfully learn to compensate for distortions up to 30%, which is significantly higher than what might be expected in an actual channel.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

No explanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we show that the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and can be optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The key to this finding lies in the distinction between classification and probability estimation: correct classification can be achieved even when the probability estimates used contain large errors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality of the SBC is a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the actual one. This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and several sufficient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, the SBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption.

However, problems can arise in their application when the density of interest is high dimensional and strongly correlated. In these circumstances the sampler may be slow to traverse the state space and mixing is poor. In this article we offer a partial solution to this problem. The state space of the Markov chain is augmented to accommodate multiple chains in parallel. Updates to individual chains are based around a genetic style crossover operator acting on `parent' states drawn from the population of chains. This process makes efficient use of gradient information implicitly encoded within the distribution of states across the population. Empirical studies support the claim that the crossover operator acting on a parallel population of chains improves mixing. This is illustrated with an example of sampling a high dimensional posterior probability density from a complex predictive model. By adopting a latent variable approach the methodology is extended to deal with variable selection and model averaging in high dimensions. This is illustrated with an example of knot selection for a spline interpolant.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The ability to execute down both paths of a conditional branch enables the branch penalty to be minimized; however, relying exclusively on dual path execution is infeasible due because instruction fetch rates far exceed the capability of the pipeline to retire a single branch before others must be processed. By using confidence information, available in the dynamic branch prediction state tables, a limited form of dual path execution becomes feasible. This reduces the burden on the branch predictor by allowing predictions of low confidence to be avoided. In this study we present a new approach to gather branch prediction confidence with little or no overhead, and use this confidence mechanism to determine whether dual path execution or branch prediction should be used. Comparing this hybrid predictor model to the dynamic branch predictor shows a dramatic decrease in misprediction rate, which translates to an reduction in runtime of over 20%.

Knowledge-based re-engineering of legacy programs for robustness in automated design. : Systems for automated design optimization of complex real-world objects can, in principle, be constructed by combining domain-independent numerical routines with existing domain-specific analysis and simulation programs. Unfortunately, such legacy analysis codes are frequently unsuitable for use in automated design. They may crash for large classes of input, be numerically unstable or locally non-smooth, or be highly sensitive to control parameters. To be useful, analysis programs must be modified to reduce or eliminate only the undesired behaviors, without altering the desired computation. To do this by direct modification of the programs is labor-intensive, and necessitates costly revalidation. We have implemented a high-level language and run-time environment that allow failure-handling strategies to be incorporated into existing Fortran and C analysis programs while preserving their computational integrity. Our approach relies on globally managing the execution of these programs at the level of discretely callable functions so that the computation is only affected when problems are detected. Problem handling procedures are constructed from a knowledge base of generic problem management strategies. We show that our approach is effective in improving analysis program robustness and design optimization performance in the domain of conceptual design of jet engine nozzles.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The new algorithms select step-size parameters online in such a way as to eliminate the bias normally inherent in temporal-difference methods.

At the heart of each such process is an \"evaluator\", which compares the accuracy of the current theory KB with that of each of its \"neighbors\" f k (KB)g, with the goal of determining which neighbor has the highest accuracy. The obvious \"wrapper\" evaluator simply evaluates each individual neighbor theory KB k = k (KB) on each instance c j . As it can be very expensive to evaluate a single theory on a single instance, and there can be a great many training instances and a huge number of neighbors, this approach can be prohibitively slow. We present an alternative system which employs a smarter evaluator that quickly computes the accuracy of a transformed theory k (KB) by \"looking inside\" KB and reasoning about the effects of the k transformation.

The outcome of data and control decisions is predicted, and the operations are speculatively executed and only committed if the original predictions were correct. There are a number of other ways that processor resources could be used, such as threading or eager execution. As the use of speculation increases, we believe more processors will need some form of speculation control to balance the benefits of speculation against other possible activities. Confidence estimation is one technique that can be exploited by architects for speculation control. In this paper, we introduce performance metrics to compare confidence estimation mechanisms, and argue that these metrics are appropriate for speculation control. We compare a number of confidence estimation mechanisms, focusing on mechanisms that have a small implementation cost and gain benefit by exploiting characteristics of branch predictors, such as clustering of mispredicted branches. We compare the performance of the different confidence estimation methods using detailed pipeline simulations. Using these simulations, we show how to improve some confidence estimators, providing better insight for future investigations comparing and applying confidence estimators.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

A continuing source of uncertainty is how long such a sampler must be run in order to converge approximately to its target stationary distribution. Rosenthal (1995b) presents a method to compute rigorous theoretical upper bounds on the number of iterations required to achieve a specified degree of convergence in total variation distance by verifying drift and minorization conditions. We propose the use of auxiliary simulations to estimate the numerical values needed in Rosenthal's theorem. Our simulation method makes it possible to compute quantitative convergence bounds for models for which the requisite analytical computations would be prohibitively difficult or impossible. On the other hand, although our method appears to perform well in our example problems, it can not provide the guarantees offered by analytical proof. Acknowledgements.

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n Speculative hedge: Regulating compile-time speculation against profile variations. : Path-oriented scheduling methods, such as trace scheduling and hyperblock scheduling, use speculation to extract instruction-level parallelism from control-intensive programs. These methods predict important execution paths in the current scheduling scope using execution profiling or frequency estimation. Aggressive speculation is then applied to the important execution paths, possibly at the cost of degraded performance along other paths. Therefore, the speed of the output code can be sensitive to the compiler's ability to accurately predict the important execution paths. Prior work in this area has utilized the speculative yield function by Fisher, coupled with dependence height, to distribute instruction priority among execution paths in the scheduling scope. While this technique provides more stability of performance by paying attention to the needs of all paths, it does not directly address the problem of mismatch between compile-time prediction and run-time behavior. The work presented in this paper extends the speculative yield and dependence height heuristic to explicitly minimize the penalty suffered by other paths when instructions are speculated along a path. Since the execution time of a path is determined by the number of cycles spent between a path's entrance and exit in the scheduling scope, the heuristic attempts to eliminate unnecessary speculation that delays any path's exit. Such control of speculation makes the performance much less sensitive to the actual path taken at run time. The proposed method has a strong emphasis on achieving minimal delay to all exits. Thus the name, speculative hedge, is used. This paper presents the speculative hedge heuristic, and shows how it controls over-speculation in a superblock/hyperblock scheduler.

In: Evolutionary systems have been used in a variety of applications, from turbine design to scheduling problems. The basic algorithms are similar in all these applications, but the representation is always problem specific. Unfortunately, the search time for evolutionary systems very much depends on efficient codings, using problem specific domain knowledge to reduce the size of the search space. This paper describes an approach, where the user only specifies a very general, basic coding that can be used in a larger variety of problems. The system then learns a more efficient, problem specific coding. To do this, an evolutionary system with variable length coding is used. While the system optimizes an example problem, a meta process identifies successful combinations of genes in the population and combines them into higher level evolved genes. The extraction is repeated iteratively, allowing genes to evolve that have a high level complexity and encode a high number of the original, basic genes. This results in a continuous restructuring of the search space, allowing potentially successful solutions to be found in much shorter search time. The evolved coding can then be used to solve other, related problems. While not excluding any potentially desirable solutions, the evolved coding makes knowledge from the example problem available for the new problem.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Although this is acceptable in some applications there are many more situations where such an approximation is difficult and unnatural. For instance, in applications such as robotic,s where real machines interact with the real world, learning techniques that use real valued continuous quantities are required. Presented in this paper is an extension to Q-learning that uses both real valued states and actions. This is achieved by introducing activation strengths to each actuator system of the robot. This allow all actuators to be active to some continuous amount simultaneously. Learning occurs by incrementally adapting both the expected future reward to goal evaluation function and the gradients of that function with respect to each actuator system.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The computational requirements for estimating the resultant generalization error on a test set by means of cross-validation are often prohibitive; for leave-one-out cross-validation one needs to train the underlying algorithm on the order of m- times, where m is the size of the training set and is the number of replicates. This paper presents several techniques for exploiting the bias-variance decomposition [GBD92, Wol96] to estimate the generalization error of a bagged learning algorithm without invoking yet more training of the underlying learning algorithm. The best of our estimators exploits stacking [Wol92]. In a set of experiments reported here, it was found to be more accurate than both the alternative cross-validation-based estimator of the bagged algorithm's error and the cross-validation-based estimator of the underlying algorithm's error.

In semi-flexible prediction, learning should improve prediction of a specific set of features known a priori rather than a single known feature (as in classification) or an arbitrary set of features (as in conceptual clustering). We describe one such task from natural language processing and present experiments that compare solutions to the problem using decision trees, CBL, and a hybrid approach that combines the two. In the hybrid approach, decision trees are used to specify the features to be included in k-nearest neighbor case retrieval. Results from the experiments show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the decision tree and case-based approaches as well as two case-based systems that incorporate expert knowledge into their case retrieval algorithms.

For recurrent neural networks no general methods exist that permit the estimation of the number of layers of hidden neurons, the size of layers or the number of weights. We present a simple pruning heuristic which significantly improves the generalization performance of trained recurrent networks. We illustrate this heuristic by training a fully recurrent neural network on positive and negative strings of a regular grammar. We also show that if rules are extracted from networks trained to recognize these strings, that rules extracted after pruning are more consistent with the rules to be learned. This performance improvement is obtained by pruning and retraining the networks. Simulations are shown for training and pruning a recurrent neural net on strings generated by two regular grammars, a randomly-generated 10-state grammar and an 8-state triple parity grammar. Further simulations indicate that this pruning method can gives generalization performance superior to that obtained by training with weight decay.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

This agent differs from other adaptive agents because it has the ability to not only learn how to assist a user in some task, but also to incrementally adapt its knowledge representation space to better fit the given learning task. The agents ability to autonomously make problem-oriented modifications to the originally given representation space is due to its constructive induction (CI) learning method. Selective induction (SI) learning methods, and agents based on these methods, rely on a good representation space. A good representation space has no misclassification noise, inter-correlated attributes or irrelevant attributes. Our proposed CILA has methods for overcoming all of these problems. In agent domains with poor representations, the CI-based learning agent will learn more accurate rules and be more useful than an SI-based learning agent. This paper gives an architecture for a CI-based learning agent and gives an empirical comparison of a CI and SI for a set of six abstract domains involving DNF-type (disjunctive normal form) descriptions.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Distance functions like the Hamming-distance or their transformation into similarity functions are applied to retrieve past cases to be used to generate the solution of an actual problem. Often, domain knowledge is available to adapt past solutions to new problems or to evaluate solutions. However, there are domains like architectural design or law in which structural case representations and corresponding structural similarity functions are needed. Often, the acquisition of adaptation knowledge seems to be impossible or rather requires an effort that is not manageable for fielded applications. Despite of this, humans use cases as the main source to generate adapted solutions. How to achieve this computationally? This paper presents a general approach to structural similarity assessment and adaptation. The approach allows to explore structural case representations and limited domain knowledge to support design tasks.

In this paper we review the advantages of instance based methods for autonomous systems, but we also note the ensuing cost: hopelessly slow computation as the database grows large. We present and evaluate a new way of structuring a database and a new algorithm for accessing it that maintains the advantages of instance-based learning. Earlier attempts to combat the cost of instance-based learning have sacrificed the explicit retention of all data, or been applicable only to instance-based predictions based on a small number of near neighbors or have had to re-introduce an explicit training phase in the form of an interpolative data structure. Our approach builds a multiresolution data structure to summarize the database of experiences at all resolutions of interest simultaneously. This permits us to query the database with the same exibility as a conventional linear search, but at greatly reduced computational cost.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We evaluate the performance of this learning algorithm T2 on 15 common real-world datasets, and show that for most of these datasets T2 provides simple decision trees with little or no loss in predictive power (compared with C4.5). In fact, for datasets with continuous attributes its error rate tends to be lower than that of C4.5. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a PAC-learning algorithm is shown to be applicable to real-world classification problems. Since one can prove that T2 is an agnostic PAC-learning algorithm, T2 is guaranteed to produce close to optimal 2-level decision trees from sufficiently large training sets for any (!) distribution of data. In this regard T2 differs strongly from all other learning algorithms that are considered in applied machine learning, for which no guarantee can be given about their performance on new datasets. We also demonstrate that this algorithm T2 can be used as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of the expressive limits of 2-level decision trees. Finally, T2, in combination with new bounds on the VC-dimension of decision trees of bounded depth that we derive, provides us now for the first time with the tools necessary for comparing learning curves of decision trees for real-world datasets with the theoretical estimates of PAC learning theory.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

However, whereas MBR uses specific cases to perform classification, Bayesian methods summarize the data probabilistically. We demonstrate that a particular MBR system called Pebls works comparatively well on a wide range of domains using both real and artificial data. With respect to the artificial data, we consider distributions where the concept classes are separated by functional discriminants, as well as time-series data generated by Markov models of varying complexity. Finally, we show formally that Pebls can learn (in the limit) natural concept classes that the Bayesian classifier cannot learn, and that it will attain perfect accuracy whenever\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The proposed answer is that such knowledge should be learned and represented in a declarative form. When needed for decision making, it should be efficiently transferred to a procedural form that is tailored to the specific decision making situation. Such an approach combines advantages of the declarative representation, which facilitates learning and incremental knowledge modification, and the procedural representation, which facilitates the use of knowledge for decision making. This approach also allows one to determine decision structures that may avoid attributes that unavailable or difficult to measure in any given situation. Experimental investigations of the system, FRD-1, have demonstrated that decision structures obtained via the declarative route often have not only higher predictive accuracy but are also are simpler than those learned directly from facts.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but currently has yielded relatively little that is of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of thirteen convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.

In this paper, we concentrate on the latter which is usually tackled through the use of learning algorithms that employ discounted rewards. We argue that for realistic problems this kind of solution is not satisfactory, since it does not address the effect of noise originating from different experiences and does not allow for an easy explanation of the parameters involved in the learning process. As a possible solution, we propose to keep the delayed reward undiscounted, but to discount the actual adaptation rate.

This paper shows that attribute noise, missing attributes, class noise, and training set size can each cause small disjuncts to be more error prone than large disjuncts. This paper also evaluates the impact that these factors have on learning with small disjuncts (i.e., on the error rate).

In particular, the reconstruction of very large trees containing significant amounts of divergence is especially challenging. We present in this paper a new tree reconstruction method, which we call the Disk-Covering Method, which can be used to recover accurate estimations of the evolutionary tree for otherwise intractable datasets. DCM obtains a decomposition of the input dataset into small overlapping sets of closely related taxa, reconstructs trees on these subsets (using a \"base\" phylogenetic method of choice), and then combines the subtrees into one tree on the entire set of taxa. Because the subproblems analyzed by DCM are smaller, com-putationally expensive methods such as maximum likelihood estimation can be used without incurring too much cost. At the same time, because the taxa within each subset are closely related, even very simple methods (such as neighbor-joining) are much more likely to be highly accurate. The result is that DCM-boosted methods are typically faster and more accurate as compared to \"naive\" use of the same method. In this paper we describe the basic ideas and techniques in DCM, and demonstrate the advantages of DCM experimentally by simulating sequence evolution on a variety of trees.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The entropy of this distribution is an extension of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) entropy, reducing to it exactly in the limit of infinite temperature. The close relationship between the VC and Gardner entropies can be seen within the replica formalism. There has been recent progress towards understanding the relationship between the statistical physics and Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) approaches to learning theory[1, 2, 3, 4]. The two approaches can be unified in a statistical mechanics based on the VC entropy. This paper treats the case of learning randomly labeled patterns, or the capacity problem, and extends some of the results of previous work[5, 6] to finite temperature. As will be explained in a companion paper, this extension is important for treating the generalization problem, which occurs in the context of learning patterns labeled by a target rule. Our general framework is illustrated for the simple perceptron sgn(w x), which maps an N -dimensional real-valued input x to a 1-valued output. Given a sample X = (x 1 ; : : : ; x m ) of inputs, the weight vector w determines a labeling L = (l 1 ; : : : ; l m ) of the sample via l i = sgn(w x i ). The weight vector w defines a normal hyperplane that separates the positive from the negative examples. The training error of a labeling L with respect to a reference labeling L 0 is defined by 1 m X 1 l i l 0 and is just the fraction of different labels in the two labelings.

The good performance (in terms of the log-likelihood obtained on test data) achieved by the APFAs and the incredibly small amount of time needed for learning suggests that the learning algorithm of APFAs might be a powerful alternative to commonly used probabilistic models.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Since any NP-complete problem can be mapped into any other one in polynomial time, the strategy described here consists of identifying a canonical NP-complete problem on which GAs work well, and solving other NP-complete problems indirectly by mapping them onto the canonical problem. Initial empirical results are presented which support the claim that the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is a GA-effective canonical problem, and that other NP-complete problems with poor GA representations can be solved efficiently by mapping them first onto SAT problems.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Resulting time series of quality monitors provide information relevant to evaluating patterns of variability in hospital-specific quality of care over time and across care areas, and to compare and assess differences across hospitals. In collaboration with the VA management services group we have developed various models for evaluating such patterns of dependencies and combining data across the VA hospital system. This paper provides a brief overview of resulting models, some summary examples on three monitor time series, and discussion of data, modelling and inference issues. This work introduces new models for multivariate non-Gaussian time series. The framework combines cross-sectional, hierarchical models of the population of hospitals with time series structure to allow and measure time-variations in the associated hierarchical model parameters. In the VA study, the within-year components of the models describe patterns of heterogeneity across the population of hospitals and relationships among several such monitors, while the time series components describe patterns of variability through time in hospital-specific effects and their relationships across quality monitors. Additional model components isolate unpredictable aspects of variability in quality monitor outcomes, by hospital and care areas.

The classification performance of the decision tree on unseen data is used as a measure of fitness for the given feature set, which, in turn, is used by the GA to evolve better feature sets. This GA-ID3 process iterates until a feature subset is found with satisfactory classification performance. Experimental results are presented which illustrate the feasibility of our approach on difficult problems involving recognizing visual concepts in satellite and facial image data.

Integrity constraints are first order clauses that can play the role of negative examples in an inductive process. One integrity constraint can replace a long list of ground negative examples. However, checking the consistency of a program with a set of integrity constraints usually involves heavy the orem-proving.

We introduce a procedure, SureShrink, which suppresses noise by thresholding the empirical wavelet coefficients. The thresholding is adaptive: a threshold level is assigned to each dyadic resolution level by the principle of minimizing the Stein Unbiased Estimate of Risk (Sure) for threshold estimates. The computational effort of the overall procedure is order N log(N ) as a function of the sample size N. SureShrink is smoothness-adaptive: if the unknown function contains jumps, the reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the unknown function has a smooth piece, the reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the mother wavelet will allow. The procedure is in a sense optimally smoothness-adaptive: it is near-minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the Besov scale; the size of this interval depends on the choice of mother wavelet. We know from a previous paper by the authors that traditional smoothing methods kernels, splines, and orthogonal series estimates - even with optimal choices of the smoothing parameter, would be unable to perform in a near-minimax way over many spaces in the Besov scale.

For multilayer perceptron networks, where the parameters are the connection weights, the prior lacks any direct meaning | what matters is the prior over functions computed by the network that is implied by this prior over weights. In this paper, I show that priors over weights can be defined in such a way that the corresponding priors over functions reach reasonable limits as the number of hidden units in the network goes to infinity. When using such priors, there is thus no need to limit the size of the network in order to avoid \"overfitting\". The infinite network limit also provides insight into the properties of different priors. A Gaussian prior for hidden-to-output weights results in a Gaussian process prior for functions, which can be smooth, Brownian, or fractional Brownian, depending on the hidden unit activation function and the prior for input-to-hidden weights. Quite different effects can be obtained using priors based on non-Gaussian stable distributions. In networks with more than one hidden layer, a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian priors appears most interesting.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Among the many extensions to the NETtalk system were the following: a different learning algorithm, a wider input \"window\", error-correcting output coding, a right-to-left scan of the word to be pronounced (with the results of each decision influencing subsequent decisions), and the addition of several useful input features. These changes yielded a system that performs much better than the original NETtalk system. After training on 19,002 words, the system achieves 93.7% correct pronunciation of individual phonemes and 64.8% correct pronunciation of whole words (where the pronunciation must exactly match the dictionary pronunciation to be correct). Based on the judgements of three human participants in a blind assessment study, our system was estimated to have a serious error rate of 16.7% (on whole words) compared to an error rate of 26.1% for the DECTalk3.0 rulebase.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In their simplest form (i.e., when parameters are updated one at a time) they are, however, often slow to converge when applied to high-dimensional statistical models. A remedy for this problem is to block the parameters into groups, which are then updated simultaneously using either a Gibbs or Metropolis-Hastings step. In this paper we construct several (partially and fully blocked) MCMC algorithms for minimizing the autocorrelation in MCMC samples arising from important classes of longitudinal data models. We exploit an identity used by Chib (1995) in the context of Bayes factor computation to show how the parameters in a general linear mixed model may be updated in a single block, improving convergence and producing essentially independent draws from the posterior of the parameters of interest. We also investigate the value of blocking in non-Gaussian mixed models, as well as in a class of binary response data longitudinal models. We illustrate the approaches in detail with three real-data examples.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In previous work we demonstrated the performance potential of simultaneous multithreading, based on a somewhat idealized model. In this paper we show that the throughput gains from simultaneous multithreading can be achieved without extensive changes to a conventional wide-issue superscalar, either in hardware structures or sizes. We present an architecture for simultaneous multithreading that achieves three goals: (1) it minimizes the architectural impact on the conventional superscalar design, (2) it has minimal performance impact on a single thread executing alone, and (3) it achieves significant throughput gains when running multiple threads. Our simultaneous multithreading architecture achieves a throughput of 5.4 instructions per cycle, a 2.5-fold improvement over an unmodified superscalar with similar hardware resources. This speedup is enhanced by an advantage of multithreading previously unexploited in other architectures: the ability to favor for fetch and issue those threads most efficiently using the processor each cycle, thereby providing the best instructions to the processor.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

It is hard to evolve a solution ahead of time that can cope effectively with all the possible environments that might arise in the future and with all the possible ways someone may interact with it. This paper proposes evolving feedforward neural networks online to create agents that improve their performance through real-time interaction. This approach is demonstrated in a game world where neural-network-controlled individuals play against humans. Through evolution, these individuals learn to react to varying opponents while appropriately taking into account conflicting goals. After initial evaluation offline, the population is allowed to evolve online, and its performance improves considerably. The population not only adapts to novel situations brought about by changing strategies in the opponent and the game layout, but it also improves its performance in situations that it has already seen in offline training. This paper will describe an implementation of online evolution and shows that it is a practical method that exceeds the performance of offline evolution alone.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We also give the most powerful positive result to date for learning to play against finite automata, an efficient algorithm for learning to play any game against any finite automata with probabilistic actions and low cover time.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

This reverse ocular dominance shift has been previously modeled by variants of a covariance synaptic plasticity rule (Bear et al., 1990; Clothiaux et al., 1991; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988). Kasamatsu et al. (1997, 1998) showed that infusion of an NMDA receptor antagonist in adult cat primary visual cortex changes ocular dominance distribution, reduces binocularity, and reduces orientation and direction selectivity. This paper presents a novel account of the effects of these pharmacological treatments, based on the EXIN synaptic plasticity rules (Marshall, 1995), which include both an instar afferent excitatory and an outstar lateral inhibitory rule. Functionally, the EXIN plasticity rules enhance the efficiency, discrimination, and context-sensitivity of a neural network's representation of perceptual patterns (Marshall, 1995; Marshall & Gupta, 1998). The EXIN model decreases lateral inhibition from neurons outside the infusion site (control regions) to neurons inside the infusion region, during monocular deprivation. In the model, plasticity in afferent pathways to neurons affected by the pharmacological treatments is assumed to be blocked , as opposed to previous models (Bear et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1989; Reiter & Stryker, 1988), in which afferent pathways from the open eye to neurons in the infusion region are weakened . The proposed model is consistent with results suggesting that long-term plasticity can be blocked by NMDA antagonists or by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (Bear et al., 1990; Dudek & Bear, 1992; Goda & Stevens, 1996; Kirkwood et al., 1993). Since the role of plasticity in lateral inhibitory pathways in producing cortical plasticity has not received much attention, several predictions are made based on the EXIN lateral inhibitory plasticity rule.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We present a knowledge-based technique for intelligently computing gradients in the presence of such pathologies in the simulators, and show how this gradient computation method can be used as part of a gradient-based numerical optimization system. We tested the resulting system in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft, and found that using knowledge-based gradients can decrease the cost of design space search by one or more orders of magnitude.

This model is a Bayesian network incorporating temporal aspects, which we call a Dynamic Belief Network; it is used to reason under uncertainty about both the causes and consequences of the events being monitored. The basic dynamic construction of the network is data-driven. However the model construction process combines sensor data about events with externally provided information about agents' behaviour, and knowledge already contained within the model, to control the size and complexity of the network. This means that both the network structure within a time interval, and the amount of history and detail maintained, can vary over time. We illustrate the system with the example domain of monitoring robot vehicles and people in a restricted dynamic environment using light-beam sensor data. In addition to presenting a generic network structure for monitoring domains, we describe the use of more complex network structures which address two specific monitoring problems, sensor validation and the Data Association Problem.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The presented method learns such descriptions, which we call conditional M-of-N rules, using the hypothesis-driven constructive induction approach. In this approach, the representation space is modified according to patterns discovered in the iteratively generated hypotheses. The need for the M-of-N rules is detected by observing \"exclusive-or\" or \"equivalence\" patterns in the hypotheses. These patterns indicate symmetry relations among pairs of attributes. Symmetrical attributes are combined into maximal symmetry classes. For each symmetry class, the method constructs a \"counting attribute\" that adds a new dimension to the representation space. The search for hypothesis in iteratively modified representation spaces is done by the standard AQ inductive rule learning algorithm. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of solving problems that would be very difficult to tackle by any of the traditional symbolic learning methods.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The definition of what constitutes a learning bias, however, has been typically restricted to bias provided by the input language, hypothesis language, and preference criteria between competing concept hypotheses. But if bias is taken in the broader context as any basis that provides a preference for one concept change over another, then the paradigm of failure-driven processing indeed provides a bias. Bias is exhibited by the selection of examples from an input stream that are examples of failure; successful performance is filtered out. We show that the degrees of freedom are less in failure-driven learning than in success-driven learning and that learning is facilitated because of this constraint. We also broaden the definition of failure, provide a novel taxonomy of failure causes, and illustrate the interaction of both in a multistrategy learning system called Meta-AQUA.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \nModels in Evolutionary Ecology and the Validation Problem Caswell for their guidance and support. evolutionary: All models of natural systems represent an abstraction and simplification of that system. Thus all models suffer a validation problem. Should we believe that the results of the model have any bearing on reality? This is a particularly acute problem for Alife models of evolution and ecosystems. The time scale of evolution and the complexity of ecosystems make controlled experiments difficult. If Alife is ever to contribute significantly to biology, we must find methods by which we can build confidence in our models. One alternative to experimental tests of a model is to validate it against previously verified theory. I have applied a series of ecological and evolutionary validation tests to a model of species diversification. Examination of the predator-prey dynamics, trophic cascades, competitive exclusion, adaptation, and the species-area curve in the model has shown that a course grained spatial structure was inadequate to capture the realistic dynamics of an ecosystem. Only when spatial structure was extended to the local patch dynamics did the model begin to behave realistically under a wide range of parameters. Validation of the ecological dynamics of the model provides indirect support for the evolutionary behavior of the species within the ecosystem. Every model is an abstraction and a simplification. The goal of a model is to capture the essence of a system in the real world such that the behavior of the model matches the behavior of the real system. Thus for any model we may ask if it is a valid representation of the real system. Answering this question is the problem of validation. Traditionally we can try to disprove the validity of the model by collecting data from the real system and comparing it to the predictions of the model. In artificial life we rarely have that luxury. Artificial life models tend to be highly abstract and general because the field is striving to discover general properties of life. This makes experimental validation extremely difficult. The time scale of evolution tends to restrict experiments to observation of the fossil record (Benton 1990, for example) or manipulation of organisms with extremely short life-cycles in simplified environments (Krukonis 1996, for example). Similarly, the complexity and size of ecosystems makes ecological experiments cumbersome and difficult to control. An alternative form of validation can be pursued indirectly through reference to ecological and evolutionary theory. Instead of asking if the model matches the experimental data, we can ask if the model matches our understanding of the dynamics of ecology and evolution. Then, to the extent that the theories of ecology and evolution have been validated by experimental observations, we can disprove the validity of a model when it fails to match those theories. What follows is an example of this technique applied to a model designed to examine the factors that impact the origin and maintenance of species diversity. While the purpose of this model is to explore new theoretical ground in biology, the ecological and evolutionary dynamics in the model have been validated against theories of predation, competition, adaptation and island biogeography. Hraber and Milne (1997) looked at genotype diversity under the presence or absence of selection and varying mutation rates in the ECHO model (Holland 1992; 1993).

All rights reserved. Abstract We describe the results of performing data mining on a challenging medical diagnosis domain, acute abdominal pain. This domain is well known to be difficult, yielding little more than 60% predictive accuracy for most human and machine diagnosticians. Moreover, many researchers argue that one of the simplest approaches, the naive Bayesian classifier, is optimal. By comparing the performance of the naive Bayesian classifier to its more general cousin, the Bayesian network classifier, and to selective Bayesian classifiers with just 10% of the total attributes, we show that the simplest models perform at least as well as the more complex models. We argue that simple models like the selective naive Bayesian classifier will perform as well as more complicated models for similarly complex domains with relatively small data sets, thereby calling into question the extra expense necessary to induce more complex models.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

It is model-driven in that hypotheses are abstracted into rule models, which are used both for control decisions in the data-driven phase and for model-guided induction. Key Words: Inductive learning in relational domains, cooperation of data-driven and model-guided methods, implicit and declarative bias.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Adaptive Behavior, : Adaptation of ecological systems to their environments is commonly viewed through some explicit fitness function defined a priori by the experimenter, or measured a posteriori by estimations based on population size and/or reproductive rates. These methods do not capture the role of environmental complexity in shaping the selective pressures that control the adaptive process. Ecological simulations enabled by computational tools such as the Latent Energy Environments (LEE) model allow us to characterize more closely the effects of environmental complexity on the evolution of adaptive behaviors. LEE is described in this paper. Its motivation arises from the need to vary complexity in controlled and predictable ways, without assuming the relationship of these changes to the adaptive behaviors they engender. This goal is achieved through a careful characterization of environments in which different forms of \"energy\" are well-defined. A genetic algorithm using endogenous fitness and local selection is used to model the evolutionary process. Individuals in the population are modeled by neural networks with simple sensory-motor systems, and variations in their behaviors are related to interactions with varying environments. We outline the results of three experiments that analyze different sources of environmental complexity and their effects on the collective behaviors of evolving populations.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In addition, the effects of non-coding segments on both of these representations is studied. Non-coding segments are a computational model of non-coding DNA and floating building blocks mimic the location independence of genes. The fact that these structures are prevalent in natural genetic systems suggests that they may provide some advantages to the evolutionary process. Our results show that there is a significant difference in how GAs solve a problem in the fixed and floating representations. GAs are able to maintain a more diverse population with the floating representation. The combination of non-coding segments and floating building blocks appears to encourage a GA to take advantage of its parallel search and recombination abilities.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

For visual processing, researchers have long argued that an attentional mechanism is required to perform many of the tasks required by high level vision. This thesis presents VISIT, a connectionist model of covert visual attention that has been used as a vehicle for studying this interface. The model is efficient, exible, and is biologically plausible. The complexity of the network is linear in the number of pixels. Effective parallel strategies are used to minimize the number of iterations required. The resulting system is able to efficiently solve two tasks that are particularly difficult for standard bottom-up models of vision: computing spatial relations and visual search. Simulations show that the networks behavior matches much of the known psychophysical data on human visual attention. The general architecture of the model also closely matches the known physiological data on the human attention system.

This new approach is based on temporal coding by single spikes (respectively by the timing of synchronous firing in pools of neurons), rather than on the traditional interpretation of analog variables in terms of firing rates. The resulting new simulation is substantially faster and hence more consistent with experimental results about the maximal speed of information processing in cortical neural systems. As a consequence we can show that networks of noisy spiking neurons are \"universal approximators\" in the sense that they can approximate with regard to temporal coding any given continuous function of several variables. This result holds for a fairly large class of schemes for coding analog variables by firing times of spiking neurons. Our new proposal for the possible organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons systems has some interesting consequences for the type of learning rules that would be needed to explain the self-organization of such networks.

Planning and Learning by Analogical Reasoning. : Realistic and complex planning situations require a mixed-initiative planning framework in which human and automated planners interact to mutually construct a desired plan. Ideally, this joint cooperation has the potential of achieving better plans than either the human or the machine can create alone. Human planners often take a case-based approach to planning, relying on their past experience and planning by retrieving and adapting past planning cases. Planning by analogical reasoning in which generative and case-based planning are combined, as in Prodigy/Analogy, provides a suitable framework to study this mixed-initiative integration. However, having a human user engaged in this planning loop creates a variety of new research questions. The challenges we found creating a mixed-initiative planning system fall into three categories: planning paradigms differ in human and machine planning; visualization of the plan and planning process is a complex, but necessary task; and human users range across a spectrum of experience, both with respect to the planning domain and the underlying planning technology. This paper presents our approach to these three problems when designing an interface to incorporate a human into the process of planning by analogical reasoning with Prodigy/Analogy. The interface allows the user to follow both generative and case-based planning, it supports visualization of both plan and the planning rationale, and it addresses the variance in the experience of the user by allowing the user to control the presentation of information.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In contrast, as far as we can judge by now, learning rules in biological systems with many `hidden units' are local in both space and time. In this paper we propose a parallel on-line learning algorithm which performs local computations only, yet still is designed to deal with hidden units and with units whose past activations are `hidden in time'. The approach is inspired by Holland's idea of the bucket brigade for classifier systems, which is transformed to run on a neural network with fixed topology.

So a differentiated brain structure is essentially due to self-organization. Such self-organization is relevant for areas ranging from medicine to the design of intelligent complex systems. Many brain structures emerge as collective phenomenon of a microscopic neurosynaptic dynamics: a stochastic dynamics mimics the neuronal action potentials, while the synaptic dynamics is modeled by a local coupling dynamics of type Hebb-rule, that is, a synaptic efficiency increases after coincident spiking of pre- and postsynaptic neuron. The microscopic dynamics is transformed to a collective dynamics reminiscent of hydrodynamics. The theory models empirical findings quantitatively: Topology preserving neuronal maps were assumed by Descartes in 1664; their self-organization was suggested by Weiss in 1928; their empirical observation was reported by Marshall in 1941; it is shown that they are neurosynaptically stable due to ubiquitous infinitesimal short range electrical or chemical leakage. In the visual cortex, neuronal stimulus orientation preference emerges; empirically measured orientation patterns are determined by the Poisson equation of electrostatics; this Poisson equation orientation pattern emergence is derived here. Complex cognitive abilities emerge when the basic local synaptic changes are regulated by valuation, emergent valuation, attention, attention focus or combination of subnetworks. Altogether a general theory is presented for the emergence of functionality from synaptic growth in neuro-biological systems. The theory provides a transformation to a collective dynamics and is used for quantitative modeling of empirical data.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Copyright AAAI. Presenting and Analyzing the Results of AI Experiments: Abstract Experimental results reported in the machine learning AI literature can be misleading. This paper investigates the common processes of data averaging (reporting results in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the results from multiple trials) and data snooping in the context of neural networks, one of the most popular AI machine learning models. Both of these processes can result in misleading results and inaccurate conclusions. We demonstrate how easily this can happen and propose techniques for avoiding these very important problems. For data averaging, common presentation assumes that the distribution of individual results is Gaussian. However, we investigate the distribution for common problems and find that it often does not approximate the Gaussian distribution, may not be symmetric, and may be multimodal. We show that assuming Gaussian distributions can significantly affect the interpretation of results, especially those of comparison studies. For a controlled task, we find that the distribution of performance is skewed towards better performance for smoother target functions and skewed towards worse performance for more complex target functions. We propose new guidelines for reporting performance which provide more information about the actual distribution (e.g. box-whiskers plots). For data snooping, we demonstrate that optimization of performance via experimentation with multiple parameters can lead to significance being assigned to results which are due to chance. We suggest that precise descriptions of experimental techniques can be very important to the evaluation of results, and that we need to be aware of potential data snooping biases when formulating these experimental techniques (e.g. selecting the test procedure). Additionally, it is important to only rely on appropriate statistical tests and to ensure that any assumptions made in the tests are valid (e.g. normality of the distribution).\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Similar principles appear to underlie much of human visual processing, and VISOR can therefore be used to model various perceptual phenomena. This paper focuses on analyzing three phenomena through simulation with VISOR: (1) priming and mental imagery, (2) perceptual reversal, and (3) circular reaction. The results illustrate similarity and subtle differences between the mechanisms mediating priming and mental imagery, show how the two opposing accounts of perceptual reversal (neural satiation and cognitive factors) may both contribute to the phenomenon, and demonstrate how intentional actions can be gradually learned from reflex actions. Successful simulation of such effects suggests that similar mechanisms may govern human visual perception and learning of visual schemas.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Using compact, structured representations of MDPs (e.g., Bayesian networks), our methods, which vary in the tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, produce structured descriptions of (estimated) reachable states that can be used to eliminate variables or variable values from the problem description, reducing the size of the MDP and making it easier to solve. One contribution of our work is the extension of ideas from GRAPHPLAN to deal with the distributed nature of action representations typically embodied within Bayes nets and the problem of correlated action effects.

In this paper we show that this problem is computationally intractable even in surprisingly restricted cases and even if we settle for an approximation to this probability. We consider various methods used in approximate reasoning such as computing degree of belief and Bayesian belief networks, as well as reasoning techniques such as constraint satisfaction and knowledge compilation, that use approximation to avoid computational difficulties, and reduce them to model-counting problems over a propositional domain. We prove that counting satisfying assignments of propositional languages is intractable even for Horn and monotone formulae, and even when the size of clauses and number of occurrences of the variables are extremely limited. This should be contrasted with the case of deductive reasoning, where Horn theories and theories with binary clauses are distinguished by the existence of linear time satisfiability algorithms. What is even more surprising is that, as we show, even approximating the number of satisfying assignments (i.e., \"approximating\" approximate reasoning), is intractable for most of these restricted theories. We also identify some restricted classes of propositional formulae for which efficient algorithms for counting satisfying assignments can be given. fl Preliminary version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the 13th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI93. y Supported by NSF grants CCR-89-02500 and CCR-92-00884 and by DARPA AFOSR-F4962-92-J-0466.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Covering works by repeatedly specializing an overly general hypothesis, on each iteration focusing on finding a clause with a high coverage of positive examples. Divide-and-conquer works by specializing an overly general hypothesis once, focusing on discriminating positive from negative examples. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that there are cases when more accurate hypotheses can be found by divide-and-conquer than by covering. Moreover, since covering considers the same alternatives repeatedly it tends to be less efficient than divide-and-conquer, which never considers the same alternative twice. On the other hand, covering searches a larger hypothesis space, which may result in that more compact hypotheses are found by this technique than by divide-and-conquer.

A novel class of priors on parameters of latent components leads to a new class of smoothness priors on autoregressive coefficients, provides for formal inference on model order, including very high order models, and leads to the incorporation of uncertainty about model order into summary inferences. The class of prior models also allows for subsets of unit roots, and hence leads to inference on sustained though stochastically time-varying periodicities in time series. Applications to analysis of the frequency composition of time series, in both time and spectral domains, is illustrated in a study of a time series from astronomy. This analyses demonstrates the impact and utility of the new class of priors in addressing model order uncertainty and in allowing for unit root structure. Time domain decomposition of a time series into estimated latent components provides an important alternative view of the component spectral characteristics of a series. In addition, our data analysis illustrates the utility of the smoothness prior and allowance for unit root structure in inference about spectral densities. In particular, the framework overcomes supposed problems in spectral estimation with autoregressive models using more traditional model fitting methods.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Previous work in the area includes using sophisticated information exchange protocols, investigating heuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models of possibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. In order to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamic environments, we propose learning as a means to provide additional possibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcement learning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agents can learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without any knowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze and experimentally verify the effects of learning rate on system convergence, and also demonstrate the benefits of using learned coordination knowledge on similar problems.

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n: As the field of Genetic Programming (GP) matures and its breadth of application increases, the need for parallel implementations becomes absolutely necessary. The transputer-based system presented in [Koza and Andre 1995] is one of the rare such parallel implementations. Until today, no implementation has been proposed for parallel GP using a SIMD architecture, except for a data-parallel approach [Tufts 1995], although others have exploited workstation farms and pipelined supercomputers. One reason is certainly the apparent difficulty of dealing with the parallel evaluation of different S-expressions when only a single instruction can be executed at the same time on every processor. The aim of this chapter is to present such an implementation of parallel GP on a SIMD system, where each processor can efficiently evaluate a different S-expression. We have implemented this approach on a MasPar MP-2 computer, and will present some timing results. To the extent that SIMD machines, like the MasPar are available to offer cost-effective cycles for scientific experimentation, this is a useful approach. The idea of simulating a MIMD machine using a SIMD architecture is not new [Hillis and Steele 1986; Littman and Metcalf 1990; Dietz and Cohen 1992]. One of the original ideas for the Connection Machine [Hillis and Steele 1986] was that it could simulate other parallel architectures. Indeed, in the extreme, each processor on a SIMD architecture can simulate a universal Turing machine (TM). With different turing machine specifications stored in each local memory, each processor would simply have its own tape, tape head, state table and state pointer, and the simulation would be performed by repeating the basic TM operations simultaneously. Of course, such a simulation would be very inefficient, and difficult to program, but would have the advantage of being really MIMD, where no SIMD processor would be in idle state, until its simulated machine halts. Now let us consider an alternative idea, that each SIMD processor would simulate an individual stored program computer using a simple instruction set. For each step of the simulation, the SIMD system would sequentially execute each possible instruction on the subset of processors whose next instruction match it. For a typical assembly language, even with a reduced instruction set, most processors would be idle most of the time. However, if the set of instructions implemented on the virtual processor is very small, this approach can be fruitful. In the case of Genetic Programming, the \"instruction set\" is composed of the specified set of functions designed for the task. We will show below that with a precompilation step, simply adding a push, a conditional, and unconditional branching and a stop instruction, we can get a very effective MIMD simulation running.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

First, local regions of code have limited parallelism, and control dependence analysis is useful in extracting global parallelism from different parts of a program. Second, a superscalar processor is fundamentally limited because it cannot execute independent regions of code concurrently. Higher performance can be obtained with machines, such as multiprocessors and dataflow machines, that can simultaneously follow multiple flows of control. Finally, without speculative execution to allow instructions to execute before their control dependences are resolved, only modest amounts of parallelism can be obtained for programs with complex control flow.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state. In spite of these complications, we show results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control algorithms of which we are aware.

However, certain branches are difficult to predict. One solution to this problem is to evaluate both paths following such a conditional branch. Predicated execution can be used to implement this form of multi-path execution. Predicated architectures fetch and issue instructions that have associated predicates. These predicates indicate if the instruction should commit its result. Predicating a branch reduces the number of branches executed, eliminating the chance of branch misprediction at the cost of executing additional instructions. In this paper, we propose a restricted form of multi-path execution called Dynamic Predication for architectures with little or no support for predicated instructions in their instruction set. Dynamic predication dynamically predicates instruction sequences in the form of a branch hammock, concurrently executing both paths of the branch. A branch hammock is a short forward branch that spans a few instructions in the form of an if-then or if-then-else construct. We mark these and other constructs in the executable. When the decode stage detects such a sequence, it passes a predicated instruction sequence to a dynamically scheduled execution core. Our results show that dynamic predication can accrue speedups of up to 13%.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

This paper identifies and demonstrates a new application area for network-based inference techniques - the management of causal analysis in clinical experimentation. These techniques, which were originally developed for medical diagnosis, are shown capable of circumventing one of the major problems in clinical experiments the assessment of treatment efficacy in the face of imperfect compliance. While standard diagnosis involves purely probabilistic inference in fully specified networks, causal analysis involves partially specified networks in which the links are given causal interpretation and where the domain of some variables are unknown. The system presented in this paper provides the clinical research community, we believe for the first time, an assumption-free, unbiased assessment of the average treatment effect. We offer this system as a practical tool to be used whenever full compliance cannot be enforced and, more broadly, whenever the data available is insufficient for answering the queries of interest to the clinical investigator.

Explicitly, we model the noise data values x j as arising from a Dirich-let process mixture of normals, in addition to modeling the location prior G() as a Dirichlet process itself.

In particular, Boyan and Moore reported at last year's meeting a series of negative results in attempting to apply dynamic programming together with function approximation to simple control problems with continuous state spaces. In this paper, we present positive results for all the control tasks they attempted, and for one that is significantly larger. The most important differences are that we used sparse-coarse-coded function approximators (CMACs) whereas they used mostly global function approximators, and that we learned online whereas they learned o*ine. Boyan and Moore and others have suggested that the problems they encountered could be solved by using actual outcomes (\"rollouts\"), as in classical Monte Carlo methods, and as in the TD() algorithm when = 1. However, in our experiments this always resulted in substantially poorer performance.

This is a subtle limitation to parallelism that is not readily evident as it appears as a true dependency on the stack pointer. Other methods can be used that do not employ a stack to remove this dependency. In this paper we show that its removal exposes far more parallelism than has been seen previously. We refer to this type of parallelism as \"parallelism at a distance\" because it requires impossibly large instruction windows for detection. We conclude with two observations: 1) that a single instruction window characteristic of superscalar machines is inadequate for detecting parallelism at a distance; and 2) in order to take advantage of this parallelism the compiler must be involved, or separate threads must be explicitly programmed.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them the perfect monitoring case the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other the imperfect monitoring case all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The hypothesis language determines the search space. In standard inductive learning algorithms, the structure of the search space is determined by generalization/specialization operators. Algorithms perform locally optimal search by using a hill-climbing and/or a beam-search strategy. To overcome this limitation, concept learning can be viewed as stochastic search of the space of concept descriptions. The proposed stochastic search method is based on simulated annealing which is known as a successful means for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The stochastic search method, implemented in a rule learning system ATRIS, is based on a compact and efficient representation of the problem and the appropriate operators for structuring the search space. Furthermore, by heuristic pruning of the search space, the method enables also handling of imperfect data. The paper introduces the stochastic search method, describes the ATRIS learning algorithm and gives results of the experiments.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In this paper we propose a different approach for bounding the generalization error after the data has been observed.

In addition, when two eyes innervate the same target structure, the two sets of fibres segregate to form ocular dominance stripes. Experimental evidence from the frog and goldfish suggests that these two phenomena may be subserved by the same mechanisms. We present a computational model that addresses the formation of both topography and ocular dominance. The model is based on a form of competitive learning with subtractive enforcement of a weight normalization rule. Inputs to the model are distributed patterns of activity presented simultaneously in both eyes. An important aspect of this model is that ocular dominance segregation can occur when the two eyes are positively correlated, whereas previous models have tended to assume zero or negative correlations between the eyes. This allows investigation of the dependence of the pattern of stripes on the degree of correlation between the eyes: we find that increasing correlation leads to narrower stripes.

One key problem is how to assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so it is necessary to discretize numeric values by classification. Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality. We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal in the sense that they maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some other weighting methods.

We thank John Clement for the use of his protocol transcript, James Greeno for his contribution to developing our constructive modeling interpretation of it, and Ryan Tweney for his helpful comments Todd W. Griffith, Nancy J. Nersessian, and Ashok Goel Abstract We hypothesize generic models to be central in conceptual change in science. This hypothesis has its origins in two theoretical sources. The first source, constructive modeling, derives from a philosophical theory that synthesizes analyses of historical conceptual changes in science with investigations of reasoning and representation in cognitive psychology. The theory of constructive modeling posits generic mental models as productive in conceptual change. The second source, adaptive modeling, derives from a computational theory of creative design. Both theories posit situation independent domain abstractions, i.e. generic models. Using a constructive modeling interpretation of the reasoning exhibited in protocols collected by John Clement (1989) of a problem solving session involving conceptual change, we employ the resources of the theory of adaptive modeling to develop a new computational model, ToRQUE. Here we describe a piece of our analysis of the protocol to illustrate how our synthesis of the two theories is being used to develop a system for articulating and testing ToRQUE. The results of our research show how generic modeling plays a central role in conceptual change. They also demonstrate how such an interdisciplinary synthesis can provide significant insights into scientific reasoning.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximisation has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalisation of Principal Components Analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to ten speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays.

There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems.

An important property of the algorithm is that the whole sequence of iterates is always globally convergent to a solution of the system without any additional regularity assumptions. Moreover, under standard assumptions the local su-perlinear rate of convergence is achieved. As opposed to classical globalization strategies for Newton methods, for computing the stepsize we do not use line-search aimed at decreasing the value of some merit function. Instead, linesearch in the approximate Newton direction is used to construct an appropriate hy-perplane which separates the current iterate from the solution set. This step is followed by projecting the current iterate onto this hyperplane, which ensures global convergence of the algorithm. Computational cost of each iteration of our method is of the same order as that of the classical damped Newton method. The crucial advantage is that our method is truly globally convergent. In particular, it cannot get trapped in a stationary point of a merit function. The presented algorithm is motivated by the hybrid projection-proximal point method proposed in [25].\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

However, making cross-domain analogies is hard and often requires abstractions common to the source and target domains. Recent work in case-based design suggests that generic mechanisms are one type of abstractions useful in adapting past designs. However, one important yet unexplored issue is where these generic mechanisms come from. We hypothesize that they are acquired incrementally from design experiences in familiar domains by generalization over patterns of regularity. Three important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. In this paper, we describe how structure-behavior-function models of designs in a familiar domain provide the content, and together with the problem-solving context in which learning occurs, also provide the constraints for learning generic mechanisms from design experiences.

Depending on the problem solving task at hand, different models will be appropriate. Several investigators have recently developed methods of automatically selecting among multiple models of physical systems. Our research is novel in that we are developing model selection techniques specifically suited to computer-aided design. Our approach is based on the idea that artifact performance models for computer-aided design should be chosen in light of the design decisions they are required to support. We have developed a technique called \"Gradient Magnitude Model Selection\" (GMMS), which embodies this principle. GMMS operates in the context of a hillclimbing search process. It selects the simplest model that meets the needs of the hillclimbing algorithm in which it operates. We are using the domain of sailing yacht design as a testbed for this research. We have implemented GMMS and used it in hillclimbing search to decide between a computationally expensive potential-flow program and an algebraic approximation to analyze the performance of sailing yachts. Experimental tests show that GMMS makes the design process faster than it would be if the most expensive model were used for all design evaluations. GMMS achieves this performance improvement with little or no sacrifice in the quality of the resulting design.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Unfortunately, the centralized-resource architectures of modern microprocessors are ill-suited to exploit such advances. Achieving a high level of parallelism at a reasonable clock speed requires distributing the processor resources a trend already visible in the dual-register-file architecture of the Alpha 21264. A Raw microprocessor takes an extreme position in this space by distributing all its resources such as instruction streams, register files, memory ports, and ALUs over a pipelined two-dimensional interconnect, and exposing them fully to the compiler. Compilation for instruction-level parallelism (ILP) on such distributed-resource machines requires both spatial instruction scheduling and traditional temporal instruction scheduling. This paper describes the techniques used by the Raw compiler to handle these issues. Preliminary results from a SUIF-based compiler for sequential programs written in C and Fortran indicate that the Raw approach to exploiting ILP can achieve speedups scalable with the number of processors for applications with such parallelism. The Raw architecture attempts to provide performance that is at least comparable to that provided by scaling an existing architecture, but that can achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance for applications with a large amount of parallelism. This paper offers some positive results in this direction.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predictions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross val i- dation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the rece p- tive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant i n- put features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions.

Though emergence is important, its mechanism is either not well understood or it is limited to the domain of shapes. This deficiency can be compensated by considering definitions of emergent behaviour from the Artificial Life (ALife) research community. With these new insights, it is proposed that a computational technique, called evolving representations of design genes, can be extended to emergent behaviour. We demonstrate emergent be-haviour in a co-evolutionary model of design. This co-evolutionary approach to design allows a solution space (structure space) to evolve in response to a problem space (be-haviour space). Since the behaviour space is now an active participant, behaviour may emerge with new structures at the end of the design process.

For example, monomorphic typed Genetic Programming (GP) uses type information to reduce the search space and improve performance. Unfortunately, monomorphic typed GP also loses the generality of untyped GP: the generated programs are only suitable for inputs with the specified type. Polymorphic typed GP improves over mono-morphic and untyped GP by allowing the type information to be expressed in a more generic manner, and yet still imposes constraints on the search space. This paper describes a polymorphic GP system which can generate polymorphic programs: programs which take inputs of more than one type and produces outputs of more than one type. We also demonstrate its operation through the generation of the map polymorphic program.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Yet some dissent has been expressed as to its implications. Here, dissenting arguments are reviewed and elaborated upon, explaining why the Schema Theorem has no implications for how well a GA is performing. Interpretations of the Schema Theorem have implicitly assumed that a correlation exists between parent and offspring fitnesses, and this assumption is made explicit in results based on Price's Covariance and Selection Theorem. Schemata do not play a part in the performance theorems derived for representations and operators in general. However, schemata re-emerge when recombination operators are used. Using Geiringer's recombination distribution representation of recombination operators, a \"missing\" schema theorem is derived which makes explicit the intuition for when a GA should perform well. Finally, the method of \"adaptive landscape\" analysis is examined and counterexamples offered to the commonly used correlation statistic. Instead, an alternative statistic | the transmission function in the fitness domain | is proposed as the optimal statistic for estimating GA performance from limited samples.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

A previous paper has established the first theory of the statistical mechanics of combat (SMC), developed using modern methods of statistical mechanics, baselined to empirical data gleaned from the National Training Center (NTC). This previous project has also established a JANUS(T)-NTC computer simulation/wargame of NTC, providing a statistical ``what-if '' capability for NTC scenarios. This mathematical formulation is ripe for control-theoretic extension to include human factors, a methodology previously developed in the context of teleoperated vehicles. Similar NTC scenarios differing at crucial decision points will be used for data to model the inuence of decision making on combat. The results may then be used to improve present human factors and C 2 algorithms in computer simulations/wargames. Our approach is to ``subordinate'' the SMC nonlinear stochastic equations, fitted to NTC scenarios, to establish the zeroth order description of that combat. In practice, an equivalent mathematical-physics representation is used, more suitable for numerical and formal work, i.e., a Lagrangian representation. Theoretically, these equations are nested within a larger set of nonlinear stochastic operator-equations which include C 3 human factors, e.g., supervisory decisions. In this study, we propose to perturb this operator theory about the SMC zeroth order set of equations. Then, subsets of scenarios fit to zeroth order, originally considered to be similarly degenerate, can be further split perturbatively to distinguish C 3 decision-making inuences. New methods of Very Fast Simulated Re-Annealing (VFSR), developed in the previous project, will be used for fitting these models to empirical data.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In the case of a stochastic system, these tasks typically involve the use of a belief state|a probability distribution over the state of the process at a given point in time. Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very large, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented compactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable. We investigate the idea of utilizing a compact approximation to the true belief state, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the approximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate to make our answers completely irrelevant.

We show how the additional structure of a DBN can be used to design our approximation scheme, improving its performance significantly. We demonstrate the applicability of our ideas in the context of a monitoring task, showing that orders of magnitude faster inference can be achieved with only a small degradation in accuracy.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

However, EBL is severely hampered by the requirement of a complete and correct domain theory for successful learning to occur. Clearly, in non-trivial domains, developing such a domain theory is a nearly impossible task. Therefore, much research has been devoted to understanding how an imperfect domain theory can be corrected and extended during system performance. In this paper, we present a characterization of this problem, and use it to analyze past research in the area. Past characterizations of the problem (e.g, [Mitchell et al., 1986; Rajamoney and DeJong, 1987]) have viewed the types of performance errors caused by a faulty domain theory as primary. In contrast, we focus primarily on the types of knowledge deficiencies present in the theory, and from these derive the types of performance errors that can result. Correcting the theory can be viewed as a search through the space of possible domain theories, with a variety of knowledge sources that can be used to guide the search. We examine the types of knowledge used by a variety of past systems for this purpose. The hope is that this analysis will indicate the need for a \"universal weak method\" of domain theory correction, in which different sources of knowledge for theory correction can be freely and flexibly combined.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We consider three approaches for computing this predictive distribution, and assume that the joint probability distribution for the variables belongs to a set of distributions determined by a set of parametric models. In the simplest case, the predictive distribution is computed by using the model with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) posterior probability. In the evidence approach, the predictive distribution is obtained by averaging over all the individual models in the model family. In the third case, we define the predictive distribution by using Rissanen's new definition of stochastic complexity. Our experiments performed with the family of Naive Bayes models suggest that when using all the data available, the stochastic complexity approach produces the most accurate predictions in the log-score sense. However, when the amount of available training data is decreased, the evidence approach clearly outperforms the two other approaches. The MAP predictive distribution is clearly inferior in the log-score sense to the two more sophisticated approaches, but for the 0/1-score the MAP approach may still in some cases produce the best results.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Unfortunately all of the theory and much of the practice (see Barto et al., 1983, for an exception) of RL is limited to Marko-vian decision processes (MDPs). Many real-world decision tasks, however, are inherently non-Markovian, i.e., the state of the environment is only incompletely known to the learning agent. In this paper we consider only partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), a useful class of non-Markovian decision processes. Most previous approaches to such problems have combined computationally expensive state-estimation techniques with learning control. This paper investigates learning in POMDPs without resorting to any form of state estimation. We present results about what TD(0) and Q-learning will do when applied to POMDPs. It is shown that the conventional discounted RL framework is inadequate to deal with POMDPs. Finally we develop a new framework for learning without state-estimation in POMDPs by including stochastic policies in the search space, and by defining the value or utility of a dis tribution over states.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in time O(1) and queries are processed in time O(N ), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N ) at the expense of O(log N ) time per evidence absorption.

Our results indicate that control flow prediction is a powerful and effective assist to the hardware in making more informed run time decisions about program control flow.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Neural networks have been very successful in a number of signal processing applications. We discuss fundamental limitations and inherent difficulties when using neural networks for the processing of high noise, small sample size signals. We introduce a new intelligent signal processing method which addresses the difficulties. The method uses conversion into a symbolic representation with a self-organizing map, and grammatical inference with recurrent neural networks. We apply the method to the prediction of daily foreign exchange rates, addressing difficulties with non-stationarity, overfitting, and unequal a priori class probabilities, and we find significant predictability in comprehensive experiments covering 5 different foreign exchange rates. The method correctly predicts the direction of change for the next day with an error rate of 47.1%. The error rate reduces to around 40% when rejecting examples where the system has low confidence in its prediction. The symbolic representation aids the extraction of symbolic knowledge from the recurrent neural networks in the form of deterministic finite state automata. These automata explain the operation of the system and are often relatively simple. Rules related to well known behavior such as trend following and mean reversal are extracted.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

These models are made up of many simple nodes which are highly interconnected such that computation takes place as data flows amongst the nodes of the network. To present, most models have proposed nodes based on simple analog functions, where inputs are multiplied by weights and summed, the total then optionally being transformed by an arbitrary function at the node. Learning in these systems is accomplished by adjusting the weights on the input lines. This paper discusses the use of digital (boolean) nodes as a primitive building block in connectionist systems. Digital nodes naturally engender new paradigms and mechanisms for learning and processing in connectionist networks. The digital nodes are used as the basic building block of a class of models called ASOCS (Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems). These models combine massive parallelism with the ability to adapt in a self-organizing fashion. Basic features of standard neural network learning algorithms and those proposed using digital nodes are compared and contrasted. The latter mechanisms can lead to vastly improved efficiency for many applications.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Our methods apply generally to the computation of both upper and lower bounds, as well as to generic transfer function parameterizations of the conditional probability tables (such as sigmoid and noisy-OR). We also prove rates of convergence of the accuracy of our bounds as a function of network size. Our results are derived by applying the theory of large deviations to the weighted sums of parents at each node in the network. Bounds on the marginal probabilities are computed from two contributions: one assuming that these weighted sums fall near their mean values, and the other assuming that they do not. This gives rise to an interesting trade-off between probable explanations of the evidence and improbable deviations from the mean.

The use of evolvable fitness formulae lets us work in a dynamic fitness landscape, opposed to most work, that traditionally applies to static fitness landscapes, only.

The the known prior (meta-)knowledge about the problem domain is captured in a measure function that, to each possible combination of a training set and a classifier, assigns a value describing how good the classifier is. The computational problem is then to find a classifier maximizing the measure function. We argue that measure functions are of great value for practical applications. Besides of being a tool for model selection, they: (i) force us to make explicit the relevant prior knowledge about the learning problem at hand, (ii) provide a deeper understanding of existing algorithms, and (iii) help us in the construction of problem-specific algorithms.

A neural network was evolved in a chronological backtrack search to decide the ordering of cars in a resource-limited assembly line. The network required 1/30 of the backtracks of random ordering and 1/3 of the backtracks of the maximization of future options heuristic.

In order to realize the full potential of these processors, multiple instructions must continuouslybe issued and executed in a single cycle. Consequently, instruction scheduling plays a crucial role as an optimization in this context. While early attempts at instruction scheduling were limited to compile-time approaches, the current trends are aimed at providing dynamic support in hardware. In this paper, we present the results of a detailed comparative study of the performance advantages to be derived by the spectrum of instruction scheduling approaches: from limited basic-block sched-ulers in the compiler, to novel and aggressive schedulers in hardware. A significant portion of our experimental study via simulations, is devoted to understanding the performance advantages of run-time scheduling. Our results indicate it to be effective in extracting the ILP inherent to the program trace being scheduled, over a wide range of machine and program parameters. Furthermore, we also show that this effectiveness can be further enhanced by a simple basic-block scheduler in the compiler, which optimizes for the presence of the run-time scheduler in the target; current basic-block schedulers are not designed to take advantage of this feature. We demonstrate this fact by presenting a novel basic-block scheduling algorithm that is sensitive to the lookahead hardware in the target processor. fl In Proceedings of the Third International Conference on High Performance Computing, Dec. 1996.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Many approaches to belief change have been proposed in the literature. Our goal is not to introduce yet another approach, but to examine carefully the rationale underlying the approaches already taken in the literature, and to highlight what we view as methodological problems in the literature. The main message is that to study belief change carefully, we must be quite explicit about the ontology or scenario underlying the belief change process. This is something that has been missing in previous work, with its focus on postulates. Our analysis shows that we must pay particular attention to two issues which have often been taken for granted: The first is how we model the agent's epistemic state. (Do we use a set of beliefs, or a richer structure, such as an ordering on worlds? And if we use a set of beliefs, in what language are these beliefs are expressed?) The second is the status of observations. (Are observations known to be true, or just believed? In the latter case, how firm is the belief?) For example, we argue that even postulates that have been called beyond controversy are unreasonable when the agent's beliefs include beliefs about her own epistemic state as well as the external world. Issues of the status of observations arise particularly when we consider iterated belief revision, and we must confront the possibility of revising by ' and then by :'.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

It also occurs in situations, such as lateral gene transfer, where an entire gene cannot be modeled by a unique tree.

In the wake-sleep algorithm the goal is to learn representations that are economical to describe but allow the input to be reconstructed accurately.

One of the most effective methods for learning such networks is based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Previous work has shown that this learning procedure is asymptotically successful: with probability one, it will converge to the target distribution, given a sufficient number of samples. However, the rate of this convergence has been hitherto unknown. In this work we examine the sample complexity of MDL based learning procedures for Bayesian networks. We show that the number of samples needed to learn an *-close approximation (in terms of entropy distance) with confidence ffi is O * ) 3 log 1 ffi log log 1 . This means that the sample complexity is a low-order polynomial in the error threshold and sub-linear in the confidence bound. We also discuss how the constants in this term depend on the complexity of the target distribution. Finally, we address questions of asymptotic minimality and propose a method for using the sample complexity results to speed up the learning process.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Most existing techniques, however, only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set of networks. In this paper we present a technique called Addemup that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. Addemup works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on three DNA problems show that Addemup is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing approaches.

In this paper we apply the Gamma MLP to a larger scale speech phoneme recognition problem, analyze the operation of the network, and investigate why the Gamma MLP can perform better than alternatives. The Gamma MLP is capable of employing multiple temporal resolutions (the temporal resolution is defined here, as per de Vries and Principe, as the number of parameters of freedom (i.e. the number of tap variables) per unit of time in the gamma memory this is equal to the gamma memory parameter as detailed in the paper). Multiple temporal resolutions may be advantageous for certain problems, e.g. different resolutions may be optimal for extracting different features from the input data. For the problem in this paper, the Gamma MLP is observed to use a large range of temporal resolutions. In comparison, TDNN networks typically use only a single temporal resolution. Further motivation for the Gamma MLP is related to the curse of dimensionality and the ability of the Gamma MLP to trade off temporal resolution for memory depth, and therefore increase memory depth without increasing the dimensionality of the network. The IIR MLP is a more general version of the Gamma MLP however the IIR MLP performs poorly for the problem in this paper. Investigation suggests that the error surface of the Gamma MLP is more suitable for gradient descent training than the error surface of the IIR MLP.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

These probabilities are a key component of Naive Bayes methods. Given this commonality of approach, it is of interest to consider how the differences between the two methods are linked to their relative performance in different domains.

Experiments on variants of IB1-MVDM* that lie between it and Naive Bayes in the framework are conducted on sixteen domains.

We present a methodology for the evaluation of case-based reasoning systems through systematic empirical experimentation over a range of system configurations and environmental conditions, coupled with rigorous statistical analysis of the results of the experiments. This methodology enables us to understand the behavior of the system in terms of the theory and design of the computational model, to select the best system configuration for a given domain, and to predict how the system will behave in response to changing domain and problem characteristics.

First is the robot's ability to learn a representation of the local environment and use this representation to identify which local environment it is in. This is done by first extracting features from the sensors which are more informative than just distances of obstacles in various directions. Using these features a reduced ring representation (RRR) of the local environment is derived. As the robot navigates, it learns the RRR signatures of all the new environment types it encounters. For purpose of identification, a ring matching criteria is proposed where the robot tries to match the RRR from the sensory input to one of the RRRs in its library. The second issue addressed is that of learning hill climbing control laws in the local environments. Unlike conventional neuro-controllers, a reinforcement learning framework, where the robot first learns a model of the environment and then learns the control law in terms of a neural network is proposed here. The reinforcement function is generated from the sensory inputs of the robot before and after a control action is taken. Three key results shown in this work are that (1) The robot is able to build its library of RRR signatures perfectly even with significant sensor noise for eight different local environ-mets, (2) It was able to identify its local environment with an accuracy of more than 96%, once the library is build, and (3) the robot was able to learn adequate hill climbing control laws which take it to the distinctive state of the local environment for five different environment types.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

An effective ensemble should consist of a set of networks that are not only highly correct, but ones that make their errors on different parts of the input space as well; however, most existing techniques only indirectly address the problem of creating such a set. We present an algorithm called Addemup that uses genetic algorithms to explicitly search for a highly diverse set of accurate trained networks. Addemup works by first creating an initial population, then uses genetic operators to continually create new networks, keeping the set of networks that are highly accurate while disagreeing with each other as much as possible. Experiments on four real-world domains show that Addemup is able to generate a set of trained networks that is more accurate than several existing ensemble approaches. Experiments also show that Addemup is able to effectively incorporate prior knowledge, if available, to improve the quality of its ensemble.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The input to the algorithm is, besides a logic program and positive and negative examples, a computation rule, which determines the shape of the SLD-tree that is to be pruned. It is shown that the generality of the resulting specialization is dependent on the computation rule, and experimental results are presented from using three different computation rules. The experiments indicate that the computation rule should be formulated so that the number of applications of unfolding is kept as low as possible. The algorithm, which uses a divide-and-conquer method, is also compared with a covering algorithm.

We define a natural variant of this model (\"apple tasting\") where the learner gets feedback only when the instance is accepted. We use two transformations to relate the apple tasting model to an enhanced standard model where false acceptances are counted separately from false rejections. We present a strategy for trading between false acceptances and false rejections in the standard model. From one perspective this strategy is exactly optimal, including constants. We apply our results to obtain a good general purpose apple tasting algorithm as well as nearly optimal apple tasting algorithms for a variety of standard classes, such as conjunctions and disjunctions of n boolean variables.

In this paper we introduce the property of similarity of states and a new method for approximate knowledge representation which is based on this property. We define two or more states of a node to be similar when the likelihood ratio of their probabilities does not depend on the instantiations of the other nodes in the network. We show that the similarity of states exposes redundancies in the joint probability distribution which can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in networks with multiple similar states. For example, we show that a BN2O network|a two layer networks often used in diagnostic problems|can be reduced to a very close network with multiple similar states. Probabilistic inference in the new network can be done in only polynomial time with respect to the size of the network, and the results for queries of practical importance are very close to the results that can be obtained in exponential time with the original network. The error introduced by our reduction converges to zero faster than exponentially with respect to the degree of the polynomial describing the resulting computational complexity.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In this paper we argue for structure-based case representations, which express arbitrary relations among objects in a flexible way, over more limited or inflexible methods. We motivate the distinction between these kinds of representations with examples from information retrieval systems, CBR systems, and computational models of human analogical reasoning. Structure-based representations provide the benefits of greater expres-sivity and economy. We give examples of these benefits from two case-based planning systems we have developed, CaPER and CHIRON, and show how the case matching and case acquisition costs can be reduced through the use of massively parallel techniques.

Bertsekas showed that for ll =1 the approximation is optimal with respect to a least-squares error of the value function, and that for ll =0 the approximation obtained by the TD method is poor with respect to the same metric. With respect to the error in the values, TD(1) approximates the function better than TD(0). However, with respect to the error in the differences in the values, TD(0) approximates the function better than TD(1). TD(1) is only better than TD(0) with respect to the former metric rather than the latter. In addition, direct TD( ll ) weights the errors unequally, while residual gradient methods (Baird, 1995, Harmon, Baird, & Klopf, 1995) weight the errors equally. For the case of control, a simple Markov decision process is presented for which direct TD(0) and residual gradient TD(0) both learn the optimal policy, while TD( 11 ) learns a suboptimal policy.

For those problems, a procedural approach is the natural way to construct solutions, resulting in a state space represented as a tree or a DAG. The aim of this paper is to describe the underlying heuristics used by SAGE to address problems belonging to that class.

The lack of a satisfactory, generic complexity measure for learning problems poses difficulties for researchers in various areas; the present paper puts forward an idea which may help to alleviate these. It shows that supervised learning problems fall into two, generic, complexity classes only one of which is associated with computational tractability.

Unlike both genetic and hill climbing algorithms, dynamic hill climbing has the ability to dynamically change its coordinate frame during the course of an optimization. Furthermore, the algorithm moves from a coarse-grained search to a fine-grained search of the function space by changing its mutation rate and uses a diversity-based distance metric to ensure that it searches new regions of the space. Dynamic hill climbing is empirically compared to a traditional genetic algorithm using De Jong's well-known five function test suite [4] and is shown to vastly surpass the performance of the genetic algorithm, often finding better solutions using only 1% as many function evaluations.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We quantify the goodness of greedy tree induction empirically, using the popular decision tree algorithms, C4.5 and CART. We induce decision trees on thousands of synthetic data sets and compare them to the corresponding optimal trees, which in turn are found using a novel map coloring idea. We measure the effect on greedy induction of variables such as the underlying concept complexity, training set size, noise and dimensionality.

The disadvantages of our theory are that its application requires knowledge of the input distribution, and it is limited so far to finite cardinality function classes.

This information is then used to separately customize the metric used to deflne distance from that object in flnding its nearest neighbors.

Here we concentrate on the case where the components in the target density is a spatially homogeneous Gibbs distribution with finite range. The performance of the algorithm is strongly linked to the presence or absence of phase transition for the Gibbs distribution; the convergence time being approximately linear in dimension for problems where phase transition is not present. Related to this, there is an optimal way to scale the variance of the proposal distribution in order to maximise the speed of convergence of the algorithm. This turns out to involve scaling the variance of the proposal as the reciprocal of dimension (at least in the phase transition free case). Moreover the actual optimal scaling can be characterised in terms of the overall acceptance rate of the algorithm, the maximising value being 0:234, the value as predicted by studies on simpler classes of target density. The results are proved in the framework of a weak convergence result, which shows that the algorithm actually behaves like an infinite dimensional diffusion process in high dimensions. 1.

We investigate the bloating characteristics of three non-population and one population based search techniques using a novel mutation operator. An artificial ant following the Santa Fe trail problem is solved by simulated annealing, hill climbing, strict hill climbing and population based search using two variants of the the new subtree based mutation operator. As predicted bloat is observed when using unbiased mutation and is absent in simulated annealing and both hill climbers when using the length neutral mutation however bloat occurs with both mutations when using a population.

Many methods have been developed for comparing input case descriptions to the cases already in memory. However, the success of such methods depends on the input case description being sufficiently complete to reflect the important features of the new situation, which is not assured. In case-based explanation of anomalous events during story understanding, the anomaly arises because the current situation is incompletely understood; consequently, similarity assessment based on matches between known current features and old cases is likely to fail because of gaps in the current case's description. Our solution to the problem of gaps in a new case's description is an approach that we call constructive similarity assessment. Constructive similarity assessment treats similarity assessment not as a simple comparison between fixed new and old cases, but as a process for deciding which types of features should be investigated in the new situation and, if the features are borne out by other knowledge, added to the description of the current case. Constructive similarity assessment does not merely compare new cases to old: using prior cases as its guide, it dynamically carves augmented descriptions of new cases out of memory.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In particular we are interested in modelling the learning aspects of case-based reasoning in order to study how the performance of a case-based reasoning system changes as it accumlates problem-solving experience. The current paper presents a `case-base semantics' which generalises recent formalisations of case-based classification. Within this framework, the paper explores various issues in assuring that these sematics are well-defined, and illustrates how the knowledge content of the case memory system can be seen to reside in both the chosen similarity measure and in the cases of the case-base.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The model shows that when the individuals interact in a sort of zero-sum game, the lineages maintain relatively high mutation rates. However, when individuals engage in interactions that have greater consequences for one individual in the interaction than the other, lineages tend to evolve relatively low mutation rates.

The goal of this research is to provide a general representation and processing framework for introspective reasoning for strategy selection. The learning framework for an introspective system is to perform some reasoning task. As it does, the system also records a trace of the reasoning itself, along with the results of such reasoning. If a reasoning failure occurs, the system retrieves and applies an introspective explanation of the failure in order to understand the error and repair the knowledge base. A knowledge structure called a Meta-Explanation Pattern is used to both explain how conclusions are derived and why such conclusions fail. If reasoning is represented in an explicit, declarative manner, the system can examine its own reasoning, analyze its reasoning failures, identify what it needs to learn, and select appropriate learning strategies in order to learn the required knowledge without overreli ance on the programmer.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In order to achieve the improved classification performance, a generalized finite mixture model is proposed as a linear combination scheme and implemented based on radial basis function networks. In the linear combination scheme, soft competition on different feature sets is adopted as an automatic feature rank mechanism so that different feature sets can be always simultaneously used in an optimal way to determine linear combination weights. For training the linear combination scheme, a learning algorithm is developed based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method has been applied to a typical real world problem, viz. speaker identification, in which different feature sets often need consideration simultaneously for robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields good performance in speaker identification.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Modern benchmarks generate extremely long traces, resulting in problems with data storage, as well as very long simulation run times. More fundamentally, simulation generally does not provide significant insight into the factors that determine performance or a characterization of their interactions. This paper proposes a theoretical model of superscalar processor performance that addresses these shortcomings. Performance is viewed as an interaction of program parallelism and machine parallelism. Both program and machine parallelisms are decomposed into multiple component functions. Methods for measuring or computing these functions are described. The functions are combined to provide a model of the interaction between program and machine parallelisms and an accurate estimate of the performance. The computed performance, based on this model, is compared to simulated performance for six benchmarks from the SPEC 92 suite on several configurations of the IBM RS/6000 instruction set architecture.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We first review the Markovian account of causation and show that directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) offer an economical scheme for representing conditional independence assumptions and for deducing and displaying all the logical consequences of such assumptions. We then introduce the manipulative account of causation and show that any DAG defines a simple transformation which tells us how the probability distribution will change as a result of external interventions in the system. Using this transformation it is possible to quantify, from non-experimental data, the effects of external interventions and to specify conditions under which randomized experiments are not necessary. Finally, the paper offers a graphical interpretation for Rubin's model of causal effects, and demonstrates its equivalence to the manipulative account of causation.

Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past explanations stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations. However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good \"lessons\" to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explanations from situations already in memory, and uses them to build explanations to understand novel stories about terrorism. In doing so, the system refines its understanding of the domain by filling in gaps in these explanations, by elaborating the explanations, or by learning new indices for the explanations.

Learning prototype-selection rules for case-based iterative design. : The first step for most case-based design systems is to select an initial prototype from a database of previous designs. The retrieved prototype is then modified to tailor it to the given goals. For any particular design goal the selection of a starting point for the design process can have a dramatic effect both on the quality of the eventual design and on the overall design time. We present a technique for automatically constructing effective prototype-selection rules. Our technique applies a standard inductive-learning algorithm, C4.5, to a set of training data describing which particular prototype would have been the best choice for each goal encountered in a previous design session. We have tested our technique in the domain of racing-yacht-hull design, comparing our inductively learned selection rules to several competing prototype-selection methods. Our results show that the inductive prototype-selection method leads to better final designs when the design process is guided by a noisy evaluation function, and that the inductively learned rules will often be more efficient than competing methods. Many automated design systems begin by retrieving an initial prototype from a library of previous designs, using the given design goal as an index to guide the retrieval process [14]. The retrieved prototype is then modified by a set of design modification operators to tailor the selected design to the given goals. In many cases the quality of competing designs can be assessed using domain-specific evaluation functions, and in such cases the design-modification process is often This research has benefited from numerous discussions with members of the Rutgers CAP project.

This research was supported under ARPA-funded NASA grant NAG 2-645. In the context of such case-based design systems, the choice of an initial prototype can affect both the quality of the final design and the computational cost of obtaining that design, for three reasons. First, prototype selection may impact quality when the prototypes lie in disjoint search spaces. In particular, if the system's design modification operators cannot convert any prototype into any other prototype, the choice of initial prototype will restrict the set of possible designs that can be obtained by any search process. A poor choice of initial prototype may therefore lead to a suboptimal final design. Second, prototype selection may impact quality when the design process is guided by a nonlinear evaluation function with unknown global properties. Since there is no known method that is guaranteed to find the global optimum of an arbitrary nonlinear function [7], most design systems rely on iterative local search methods whose results are sensitive to the initial starting point. Finally, the choice of prototype may have an impact on the time needed to carry out the design modification process|two different starting points may yield the same final design but take very different amounts of time to get there. In design problems where evaluating even just a single design can take tremendous amounts of time, selecting an appropriate initial prototype can be the determining factor in the success or failure of the design process. This paper describes the application of inductive learning [11] to form rules for selecting appropriate prototype designs. The paper is structured as follows.

Corporate memories form an important part of such knowledge management initiatives in a company. In this paper, we discuss how viewing corporate memories as distributed case libraries can benefit from existing techniques for distributed case-based reasoning for resource discovery and exploitation of previous expertise. We present two techniques developed in the context of multi-agent case-based reasoning for accessing and exploiting past experience from corporate memory resources. The first approach, called Negotiated Retrieval, deals with retrieving and assembling \"case pieces\" from different resources in a corporate memory to form a good overall case.

While most previous work focuses on only one of these two options, this paper investigates an alternative evolutionary approach called Breeder Genetic Programming (BGP) in which the architecture and the weights are optimized simultaneously. The genotype of each network is represented as a tree whose depth and width are dynamically adapted to the particular application by specifically defined genetic operators. The weights are trained by a next-ascent hillclimbing search. A new fitness function is proposed that quantifies the principle of Occam's razor. It makes an optimal trade-off between the error fitting ability and the parsimony of the network. Simulation results on two benchmark problems of differing complexity suggest that the method finds minimal size networks on clean data. The experiments on noisy data show that using Occam's razor not only improves the generalization performance, it also accel erates the convergence speed of evolution. fl Published in Complex Systems, 7(3): 199-220, 1993\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli. In Model I, when the modules are simple unbiased classifiers, the competition is sufficient to achieve enough of a specialization that damaging one module impairs the model's face recognition more than its object recognition, and damaging the other module impairs the model's object recognition more than its face recognition. In Model II, however, we bias the modules by providing one with low spatial frequency information and the other with high spatial frequency information. In this case, when the model's task is subordinate classification of faces and superordinate classification of objects, the low spatial frequency network shows an even stronger specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that something resembling a face processing \"module\" could arise as a natural consequence of the infant's developmental environment without being innately specified.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In this paper we examine how CN built from large numbers of relatively simple neuron-like units can be given the ability to handle problems that in typical multi-computer networks and artificial intelligence programs along with all other types of programs are always handled using extremely elaborate and precisely worked out central control (coordination, synchronization, switching, etc.). We point out the several mechanisms for central control of this un-brain-like sort that CN already have built into them albeit in hidden, often overlooked, ways. We examine the kinds of control mechanisms found in computers, programs, fetal development, cellular function and the immune system, evolution, social organizations, and especially brains, that might be of use in CN. Particularly intriguing suggestions are found in the pacemakers, oscillators, and other local sources of the brain's complex partial synchronies; the diffuse, global effects of slow electrical waves and neurohormones; the developmental program that guides fetal development; communication and coordination within and among living cells; the working of the immune system; the evolutionary processes that operate on large populations of organisms; and the great variety of partially competing partially cooperating controls found in small groups, organizations, and larger societies. All these systems are rich in control but typically control that emerges from complex interactions of many local and diffuse sources. We explore how several different kinds of plausible control mechanisms might be incorporated into CN, and assess their potential benefits with respect to their cost.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

ASOCS is based on networks of adaptive digital elements which self-modify using local information. Function specification is entered incrementally by use of rules, rather than complete input-output vectors, such that a processing network is able to extract critical features from a large environment and give output in a parallel fashion. Learning also uses parallelism and self-organization such that a new rule is completely learned in time linear with the depth of the network.

An interesting characteristic of adaptive search techniques is their ability to perform well in many problem domains while failing in others. Because of Genetic Programming's flexible tree structure, any particular problem can be represented in myriad forms. These representations have variegated effects on search performance. Therefore, an aspect of fundamental engineering significance is to find a representation which, when acted upon by Genetic Programming operators, optimizes search performance. We discover, in the case of chaotic time series prediction, that the representation commonly used in this domain does not yield optimal solutions. Instead, we find that the population converges onto one \"accurately replicating\" tree before other trees can be explored. To correct for this premature convergence we make a simple modification to the crossover operator. In this paper we review previous work with GP time series prediction, pointing out an anomalous result related to overlearning, and report the improvement effected by our modified crossover operator.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation.

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n: ARCING THE EDGE Leo Breiman Technical Report 486 , Statistics Department University of California, Berkeley CA. 94720 Abstract Recent work has shown that adaptively reweighting the training set, growing a classifier using the new weights, and combining the classifiers constructed to date can significantly decrease generalization error. Procedures of this type were called arcing by Breiman[1996]. The first successful arcing procedure was introduced by Freund and Schapire[1995,1996] and called Adaboost. In an effort to explain why Adaboost works, Schapire et.al. [1997] derived a bound on the generalization error of a convex combination of classifiers in terms of the margin. We introduce a function called the edge, which differs from the margin only if there are more than two classes. A framework for understanding arcing algorithms is defined. In this framework, we see that the arcing algorithms currently in the literature are optimization algorithms which minimize some function of the edge. A relation is derived between the optimal reduction in the maximum value of the edge and the PAC concept of weak learner. Two algorithms are described which achieve the optimal reduction. Tests on both synthetic and real data cast doubt on the Schapire et.al. There is recent empirical evidence that significant reductions in generalization error can be gotten by growing a number of different classifiers on the same training set and letting these vote for the best class. Freund and Schapire ([1995], [1996] ) proposed an algorithm called AdaBoost which adaptively reweights the training set in a way based on the past history of misclassifications, constructs a new classifier using the current weights, and uses the misclassification rate of this classifier to determine the size of its vote. In a number of empirical studies on many data sets using trees (CART or C4.5) as the base classifier (Drucker and Cortes[1995], Quinlan[1996], Freud and Schapire[1996], Breiman[1996]) AdaBoost produced dramatic decreases in generalization error compared to using a single tree. Error rates were reduced to the point where tests on some well-known data sets gave the result that CART plus AdaBoost did significantly better than any other of the commonly used classification methods (Breiman[1996] ). Meanwhile, empirical results showed that other methods of adaptive resampling (or reweighting) and combining (called \"arcing\" by Breiman [1996]) also led to low test set error rates. An algorithm called arc-x4 (Breiman[1996]) gave error rates almost identical to Adaboost. Ji and Ma[1997] worked with classifiers consisting of randomly selected hyperplanes and using a different method of adaptive resampling and unweighted voting, also got low error rates. Thus, there are a least three arcing algorithms extant, all of which give excellent classification accuracy. explanation.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The goal of learning in these MDPs is to find a policy that yields the maximum expected return per unit time. In large state spaces, computing these averages directly is not feasible; instead, the agent must estimate them by stochastic exploration of the state space. In this case, longer exploration times enable more accurate estimates and more informed decision-making. The learning curve for an MDP measures how the agent's performance depends on the allowed exploration time, T . In this paper we analyze these learning curves for a simple control problem with undiscounted rewards. In particular, methods from statistical mechanics are used to calculate lower bounds on the agent's performance in the thermodynamic limit T ! 1, N ! 1, ff = T =N (finite), where T is the number of time steps allotted per policy evaluation and N is the size of the state space. In this limit, we provide a lower bound on the return of policies that appear optimal based on imperfect statistics.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In: Journal of Computational Intelligence in Finance 6 (1998) 14-23. (Special Issue on \"Improving Generalization of Nonlinear Financial Forecasting Models\".) http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~aweigend/Research/Papers/InteractionLayer Abstract. Predictive models for financial data are often based on a large number of plausible inputs that are potentially nonlinearly combined to yield the conditional expectation of a target, such as a daily return of an asset. This paper introduces a new architecture for this task: On the output side, we predict dynamical variables such as first derivatives and curvatures on different time spans. These are subsequently combined in an interaction output layer to form several estimates of the variable of interest. Those estimates are then averaged to yield the final prediction. Independently from this idea, on the input side, we propose a new internal preprocessing layer connected with a diagonal matrix of positive weights to a layer of squashing functions. These weights adapt for each input individually and learn to squash outliers in the input. We apply these two ideas to the real world example of the daily predictions of the German stock index DAX (Deutscher Aktien Index), and compare the results to a network with a single output. The new six layer architecture is more stable in training due to two facts: (1) More information is flowing back from the outputs to the input in the backward pass; (2) The constraint of predicting first and second derivatives focuses the learning on the relevant variables for the dynamics. The architectures are compared from both the training perspective (squared errors, robust errors), and from the trading perspective (annualized returns, percent correct, Sharpe ratio).\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Abstract To achieve high performance, contemporary computer systems rely on two forms of parallelism: instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and thread-level parallelism (TLP). Wide-issue superscalar processors exploit ILP by executing multiple instructions from a single program in a single cycle. Multiprocessors (MP) exploit TLP by executing different threads in parallel on different processors. Unfortunately, both parallel-processing styles statically partition processor resources, thus preventing them from adapting to dynamically-changing levels of ILP and TLP in a program. With insufficient TLP, processors in an MP will be idle; with insufficient ILP, multiple-issue hardware on a superscalar is wasted. This paper explores parallel processing on an alternative architecture, simultaneous multithreading (SMT), which allows multiple threads to compete for and share all of the processors resources every cycle. The most compelling reason for running parallel applications on an SMT processor is its ability to use thread-level parallelism and instruction-level parallelism interchangeably. By permitting multiple threads to share the processors functional units simultaneously, the processor can use both ILP and TLP to accommodate variations in parallelism. When a program has only a single thread, all of the SMT processors resources can be dedicated to that thread; when more TLP exists, this parallelism can compensate for a lack of\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The first variant performs unsupervised learning and can be used for data visualization, clustering, and vector quantization. The main advantage over existing approaches, e.g., the Kohonen feature map, is the ability of the model to automatically find a suitable network structure and size. This is achieved through a controlled growth process which also includes occasional removal of units. The second variant of the model is a supervised learning method which results from the combination of the abovementioned self-organizing network with the radial basis function (RBF) approach. In this model it is possible in contrast to earlier approaches toperform the positioning of the RBF units and the supervised training of the weights in parallel. Therefore, the current classification error can be used to determine where to insert new RBF units. This leads to small networks which generalize very well.

We combine the standard measures of similarity (SW, FASTA, BLAST), to associate with each sequence an exhaustive list of neighboring sequences. These lists induce a (weighted directed) graph whose vertices are the sequences. The weight of an edge connecting two sequences represents their degree of similarity. This graph encodes much of the fundamental properties of the sequence space. We look for clusters of related proteins in this graph. These clusters correspond to strongly connected sets of vertices. Two main ideas underlie our work: i) Interesting homologies among proteins can be deduced by transitivity. ii) Transitivity should be applied restrictively in order to prevent unrelated proteins from clustering together. Our analysis starts from a very conservative classification, based on very significant similarities, that has many classes. Subsequently, classes are merged to include less significant similarities. Merging is performed via a novel two phase algorithm. First, the algorithm identifies groups of possibly related clusters (based on transitivity and strong connectivity) using local considerations, and merges them. Then, a global test is applied to identify nuclei of strong relationships within these groups of clusters, and the classification is refined accordingly. This process takes place at varying thresholds of statistical significance, where at each step the algorithm is applied on the classes of the previous classification, to obtain the next one, at the more permissive threshold. Consequently, a hierarchical organization of all proteins is obtained. The resulting classification splits the space of all protein sequences into well defined groups of proteins. The results show that the automatically induced sets of proteins are closely correlated with natural biological families and super families. The hierarchical organization reveals finer sub-families that make up known families of proteins as well as many interesting relations between protein families. The hierarchical organization proposed may be considered as the first map of the space of all protein sequences.

However, general dynamic programming is computationally intractable. We have developed procedures that allow more complex planning and control problems to be solved. We use second order local trajectory optimization to generate locally optimal plans and local models of the value function and its derivatives. We maintain global consistency of the local models of the value function, guaranteeing that our locally optimal plans are actually globally optimal, up to the resolution of our search procedures. Learning to do the right thing at each instant in situations that evolve over time is difficult, as the future cost of actions chosen now may not be obvious immediately, and may only become clear with time. Value functions are a representational tool that makes the consequences of actions explicit. Value functions are difficult to learn directly, but they can be built up from learned models of the dynamics of the world and the cost function. This paper focuses on how fast optimizers that only produce locally optimal answers can play a useful role in speeding up the process of computing or learning a globally optimal value function. Consider a system with dynamics x k+1 = f(x k ; u k ) and a cost function L(x k ; u k ), where x is the state of the system and u is a vector of actions or controls. The subscript k serves as a time index, but will be dropped in the equations that follow.

This work presents a novel method of characterizing this supposed activity using a Hidden Markov Model. This model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity of behavioral processes. In our study the process in hand was the simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the behavioral mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependency of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells. Thus, this cross-correlation depends on the network state of activity and not on local connectivity alone.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

More work is necessary in order to determine more precisely the relationship: We have attempted to obtain a stronger correlation between the relationship between G 0 and G 1 and performance. This has included studying the variance in the fitnesses of the members of the population, as well as observing the rate of convergence of the GP with respect to G 1 when a population was evolved for G 0 . 13 Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to obtain a significant correlation. In future work, we plan to to track the genetic diversity (we have only considered phenotypic variance so far) of populations in order to shed some light on the underlying mechanism for priming. One factor that has made this analysis difficult so far is our use of genetic programming, for which the space of genotypes is very large, (i.e., there are many redundant solutions), and for which the neighborhood structure is less easily intuited than that of a standard genetic algorithm. Since there is every reason to believe that the underlying mechanism of incremental evolution is largely independent of the peculiarities of genetic programming, we are currently investigating the incremental evolution mechanism using genetic algorithms with fixed-length genotypes. This should enable a better understanding of the mechanism. Ultimately, we will scale up this research effort to analyze incremental evolution with more than one transition between test cases. This will involve many open issues regarding the optimization of the transition schedule between test cases. 13 We performed the following experiment: Let F it(I; G) be the fitness value of a genetic program I according to the evaluation function G, and Best Of(P op; t; G) be the member I fl of population P op at time t with highest fitness according to G | in other words, I fl = Best Of (P op; t; G) maximizes F it(I; G) over all I 2 P op. A population P op 0 was evolved in the usual manner using evaluation function G 0 for t = 25 generations. However, at each generation 1 i 25 we also evaluated the current population using evaluation function G 1 , and recorded the value of F it(Best Of (P op; i; G 1 ); G 1 ). In other words, we evolved the population using G 0 as the evaluation function, but at every generation we also computed the fitness of the best individual in the population according to G 1 and saved this value. Using the same random seed and control parameters, we then evolved a population P op 1 for t = 30 generations using G 1 as the evaluation function (note that at generation 0, P op 1 is identical to P op 0 ). For all values of t, we compared F it(Best Of (P op 0 ; t; G 1 ); G 1 ) with F it(Best Of (P op 1 ; t; G 1 ); G 1 ). in order to better formalize and exploit this notion of domain difficulty.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Then the acquired knowledge is used to diagnose new tumors. The perceptron is a simple biologically inspired model for this two-class learning problem.

The learning is performed under simulation, and the resulting behaviors are then used to control the The approach to learning behaviors for robots described here reflects a particular methodology for learning via a simulation model. The motivation is that making mistakes on real systems may be costly or dangerous. In addition, time constraints might limit the number of experiences during learning in the real world, while in many cases, the simulation model can be made to run faster than real time. Since learning may require experimenting with behaviors that might occasionally produce unacceptable results if applied to the real world, or might require too much time in the real environment, we assume that hypothetical behaviors will be evaluated in a simulation model (the off-line system). As illustrated in Figure 1, the current best behavior can be placed in the real, on-line system, while learning continues in the off-line system [1]. The learning algorithm was designed to learn useful behaviors from simulations of limited fidelity. The expectation is that behaviors learned in these simulations will be useful in real-world environments. Previous studies have illustrated that knowledge learned under simulation is robust and might be applicable to the real world if the simulation is more general (i.e. has more noise, more varied conditions, etc.) than the real world environment [2]. Where this is not possible, it is important to identify the differences between the simulation and the world and note the effect upon the learning process. The research reported here continues to examine this hypothesis. The next section very briefly explains the learning algorithm (and gives pointers to where more extensive documentation can be found).

The CCBR system responds with a ranked solution display, which lists the solutions of stored cases whose problem descriptions best match the user's, and a ranked question display, which lists the unanswered questions in these cases. Users interact with these displays, either refining their problem description by answering selected questions, or selecting a solution to apply. CCBR systems should support dialogue inferencing; they should infer answers to questions that are implied by the problem description. Otherwise, questions will be listed that the user believes they have already answered. The standard approach to dialogue inferencing allows case library designers to insert rules that define implications between the problem description and unanswered questions. However, this approach imposes substantial knowledge engineering requirements. We introduce an alternative approach whereby an intelligent assistant guides the designer in defining a model of their case library, from which implication rules are derived. We detail this approach, its benefits, and explain how it can be supported through an integration with Parka-DB, a fast relational database system.

Graph coloring has many applications specially in the areas of scheduling, assignments and timetabling. The metaheuristic can be classified as a memetic algorithm since it is based on a population search in which periods of local optimization are interspersed with phases in which new configurations are created from earlier well-developed configurations or local minima of the previous iterative improvement process. The new population is created using crossover operators as in genetic algorithms.

Recently, other sequential decision-making problems have been studied prompting the development of new algorithms and analyses. We describe a new generalized model that subsumes mdps as well as many of the recent variations. We prove some basic results concerning this model and develop generalizations of value iteration, policy iteration, model-based reinforcement-learning, and Q-learning that can be used to make optimal decisions in the generalized model under various assumptions. Applications of the theory to particular models are described, including risk-averse mdps, exploration-sensitive mdps, sarsa, Q-learning with spreading, two-player games, and approximate max picking via sampling.

This paper derives a tight bound on how far from optimal the discounted return for a greedy policy based on the given value function will be as a function of the maximum norm magnitude of this Bellman residual. A corresponding result is also obtained for value functions defined on state-action pairs, as are used in Q-learning. One significant application of these results is to problems where a function approximator is used to learn a value function, with training of the approximator based on trying to minimize the Bellman residual across states or state-action pairs.

We address all these issues by giving a probabilistic interpretation to instance-based learning, where the goal is to approximate predictive distributions of the attributes of interest. In this probabilistic view the instances are not individual data items but probability distributions, and we perform Bayesian inference with a mixture of such prototype distributions. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method empirically for a wide variety of public domain classification data sets.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

ACL is an extension of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to the case in which both the background and the target theory are abductive logic programs and where an abductive notion of entailment is used as the coverage relation. In this framework, it is then possible to learn with incomplete information about the examples by exploiting the hypothetical reasoning of abduction. The paper presents the basic framework of ACL with its main characteristics and illustrates its potential in addressing several problems in ILP such as learning with incomplete information and multiple predicate learning. An algorithm for ACL is developed by suitably extending the top-down ILP method for concept learning and integrating this with an abductive proof procedure for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). A prototype system has been developed and applied to learning problems with incomplete information. The particular role of integrity constraints in ACL is investigated showing ACL as a hybrid learning framework that integrates the explanatory (discriminant) and descriptive (characteristic) settings of ILP.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We argue that a careful analysis of developmental mechanisms is useful when understanding the success of several standard GA techniques, and can clarify the relationships between more recently proposed enhancements. We provide a framework which distinguishes between two developmental mechanisms | learning and maturation | while also showing several common effects on GA search. This framework is used to analyze how maturation and local search can change the dynamics of the GA. We observe that in some contexts, maturation and local search can be incorporated into the fitness evaluation, but illustrate reasons for considering them seperately.

The desired finite-state network dynamics is achieved by programming a small subset of all weights. A worst case analysis reveals a relationship between the weight strength and the maximum allowed network size which guarantees finite-state behavior of the constructed network. We illustrate the method by encoding random DFAs with 10, 100, and 1,000 states. While the theory predicts that the weight strength scales with the DFA size, we find the weight strength to be almost constant for all the experiments.

Boosting is a general method of combining multiple classifiers due to Yoav Freund and Rob Schapire. This paper shows that boosting applied to naive Bayesian classifiers yields combination classifiers that are representationally equivalent to standard feedforward multilayer perceptrons. (An ancillary result is that naive Bayesian classification is a nonparametric, nonlinear generalization of logistic regression.) As a training algorithm, boosted naive Bayesian learning is quite different from backpropagation, and has definite advantages. Boosting requires only linear time and constant space, and hidden nodes are learned incrementally, starting with the most important. On the real-world datasets on which the method has been tried so far, generalization performance is as good as or better than the best published result using any other learning method. Unlike all other standard learning algorithms, naive Bayesian learning, with and without boosting, can be done in logarithmic time with a linear number of parallel computing units. Accordingly, these learning methods are highly plausible computationally as models of animal learning.

These two components, taken together, suggest that KDSA is more likely than SA to be able to scale up to retrieval in large knowledge bases.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Collaborations among the species are formed representing complete solutions. Species are created dynamically as needed.

Though general hardness results are known for learning distributions generated by sources with similar structure, we prove that our algorithm can indeed efficiently learn distributions generated by our more restricted sources.

This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting to for too, casual for causal, and so on. Previous approaches to this problem have been statistics-based; we compare Winnow to one of the more successful such approaches, which uses Bayesian classifiers. We find that: (1) When the standard (heavily-pruned) set of features is used to describe problem instances, Winnow performs comparably to the Bayesian method; (2) When the full (unpruned) set of features is used, Winnow is able to exploit the new features and convincingly outperform Bayes; and (3) When a test set is encountered that is dissimilar to the training set, Winnow is better than Bayes at adapting to the unfamiliar test set, using a strategy we will present for combining learning on the training set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We propose useful generalizations that consist, for the general unconstrained case, of replacing exact global solution of the subproblems by a certain natural sufficient descent condition, and, for the convex case, of inexact subproblem solution in the PVD algorithm. These modifications are the key features of the algorithm that has not been analyzed before. The proposed modified algorithms are more practical and make it easier to achieve good load balancing among the parallel processors. We present a general framework for the analysis of this class of algorithms and derive some new and improved linear convergence results for problems with weak sharp minima of order 2 and strongly convex problems.

To address this issue, we developed a method for generating declarative language bias for top-down ILP systems from high-level declarations. The key feature of our approach is the distinction between a user level and an expert level of language bias declarations. The expert provides abstract meta-declarations, and the user declares the relationship between the meta-level and the given database to obtain a low-level declarative language bias. The suggested languages allow for compact and abstract specifications of the declarative language bias for top-down ILP systems using schemata. We verified several properties of the translation algorithm that generates schemata, and applied it successfully to a few chemical domains.

Abstract Genetic Programming (GP) is an automatic method for generating computer programs, which are stored as data structures and manipulated to evolve better programs. An extension restricting the search space is Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP), which has, as a basic premise, the removal of closure by typing both the arguments and return values of functions, and by also typing the terminal set. A restriction of STGP is that there are only two levels of typing. We extend STGP by allowing a type hierarchy, which allows more than two levels of typing.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The analysis presented here reveals that this performance improvement is obtained by drastically reducing bias at the cost of increasing variance. We also show that, even in classification problems with few classes (m5), extending the codeword length beyond the limit that assures column separation yields an error reduction. This error reduction is not only in the variance, which is due to the voting mechanism used for error-correcting output codes, but also in the bias.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The representation scheme used not only constrains the class of neural architectures that are representable (evolvable) in the system, but also determines the efficiency and the time-space complexity of the evolutionary design procedure as a whole.

In this paper, it is shown how almost any error function can be used to construct a contrast function to perform the ICA estimation. In particular, this means that one can use contrast functions that are robust against outliers. As a practical method for tnding the relevant extrema of such contrast functions, a txed-point iteration scheme is then introduced.

We extend the class of queries that can be answered in several ways: (1) allowing missing tokens in a sentence or sentence fragment, (2) supporting queries about intermediate structure, such as the presence of particular nonterminals, and (3) flexible conditioning on a variety of types of evidence. Our method works by constructing a Bayesian network to represent the distribution of parse trees induced by a given PCFG.

In many applications, inputs do not come in as fixed-rate sequences, but rather as signals with time scales that can vary from one instance to the next; thus, modeling dynamic signals requires not only the ability to recognize sequences but also the ability to handle temporal changes in the signal. This paper discusses \"Tau Net,\" a neural network for modeling dynamic signals, and its application to speech. In Tau Net, sequence learning is accomplished using a combination of prediction, recurrence and time-delay connections. Temporal variability is modeled by having adaptable time constants in the network, which are adjusted with respect to the prediction error. Adapting the time constants changes the time scale of the network, and the adapted value of the network's time constant provides a measure of temporal variation in the signal. Tau Net has been applied to several simple signals: sets of sine waves differing in frequency and in phase [2], a multidimensional signal representing the walking gait of children [3], and the energy contour of a simple speech utterance [11]. Tau Net has also been shown to work on a voicing distinction task using synthetic speech data [12]. In this paper, Tau Net is applied to two speaker-independent tasks, vowel recognition (of f/ae/,/iy/,/ux/g) and consonant recognition (of f/p/,/t/,/k/g) using speech data taken from the TIMIT database. It is shown that Tau Nets, trained on medium-rate tokens, achieved about the same performance as networks without time constants trained on tokens at all rates, and performed better than networks without time constants trained on medium-rate tokens. Our results demonstrate Tau Net's ability to identify vowels and consonants at variable speech rates by extrapolating to rates not represented in the training set.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In particular, the likelihood functions of ADG models admit convenient recursive factorizations that often allow explicit maximum likelihood estimates and that are well suited to building Bayesian networks for expert systems. There may, however, be many ADGs that determine the same dependence (= Markov) model. Thus, the family of all ADGs with a given set of vertices is naturally partitioned into Markov-equivalence classes, each class being associated with a unique statistical model. Statistical procedures, such as model selection or model averaging, that fail to take into account these equivalence classes, may incur substantial computational or other inefficiencies. Recent results have shown that each Markov-equivalence class is uniquely determined by a single chain graph, the essential graph, that is itself Markov-equivalent simultaneously to all ADGs in the equivalence class. Here we propose two stochastic Bayesian model averaging and selection algorithms for essential graphs and apply them to the analysis of three discrete-variable data sets.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

This domain has been extensively studied in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) as an easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve cooperation problem.

In particular the STGP paradigm evolved strategies in which the predators were able to achieve their goal without explicitly sensing the location of other predators or communicating with other predators. This is an improvement over previous research in this area. The results of our experiments indicate that STGP is able to evolve programs that perform significantly better than GP evolved programs.

We measure the performance of a standard genetic algorithm on an elementary set of problem instances consisting of embedded cliques in random graphs. We indicate the need for improvement, and introduce a new genetic algorithm, the multi-phase annealed GA, which exhibits superior performance on the same problem set. As we scale up the problem size and test on \"hard\" benchmark instances, we notice a degraded performance in the algorithm caused by premature convergence to local minima. To alleviate this problem, a sequence of modifications are implemented ranging from changes in input representation to systematic local search. The most recent version, called union GA, incorporates the features of union cross-over, greedy replacement, and diversity enhancement. It shows a marked speed-up in the number of iterations required to find a given solution, as well as some improvement in the clique size found. We discuss issues related to the SIMD implementation of the genetic algorithms on a Thinking Machines CM-5, which was necessitated by the intrinsically high time complexity (O(n 3 )) of the serial algorithm for computing one iteration. Our preliminary conclusions are: (1) a genetic algorithm needs to be heavily customized to work \"well\" for the clique problem; (2) a GA is computationally very expensive, and its use is only recommended if it is known to find larger cliques than other algorithms; (3) although our customization effort is bringing forth continued improvements, there is no clear evidence, at this time, that a GA will have better success in circumventing local minima.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We argue that both belief revision and belief update are too restrictive; routine belief change involves elements of both. We present a model for generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform the agent about its prior beliefs. This model of update combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change.

Although the inferences that can be drawn from a reasoner's knowledge and from available inputs is very large (potentially infinite), the inferential resources available to any reasoning system are limited. With limited inferential capacity and very many potential inferences, reasoners must somehow control the process of inference. Not all inferences are equally useful to a given reasoning system. Any reasoning system that has goals (or any form of a utility function) and acts based on its beliefs indirectly assigns utility to its beliefs. Given limits on the process of inference, and variation in the utility of inferences, it is clear that a reasoner ought to draw the inferences that will be most valuable to it. This paper presents an approach to this problem that makes the utility of a (potential) belief an explicit part of the inference process. The method is to generate explicit desires for knowledge. The question of focus of attention is thereby transformed into two related problems: How can explicit desires for knowledge be used to control inference and facilitate resource-constrained goal pursuit in general? and, Where do these desires for knowledge come from? We present a theory of knowledge goals, or desires for knowledge, and their use in the processes of understanding and learning.

These are the largest eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector for the Jacobian of the EM operator at a maximum likelihood estimate, which are important for assessing convergence in iterative simulation. An estimate of the largest fraction of missing information is available from the EM iterates; this is often adequate since only a few figures of accuracy are needed. In some instances the EM iteration also gives an estimate of the worst linear function. We show that the power method for eigencomputation can be used to compute efficient and accurate estimates of both quantities. Unlike eigenvalue decomposition, the power method computes only the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix, it can take advantage of a good eigenvector estimate as an initial value and it can be terminated after only a few figures of accuracy are obtained. Moreover, the matrix products needed in the power method can be computed by extrapolation, obviating the need to form the Jacobian of the EM operator. We give results of simultation studies on multivariate normal data showing this approach becomes more efficient as the data dimension increases than methods that use a finite-difference approximation to the Jacobian, which is the only general-purpose alternative available. fl Funded by National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Reseach Grant 5R44CA65147-03, and by Office of Naval Research contracts N00014-96-1-0192 and N00014-96-1-0330.

In both cases, the GA discovered rules that gave rise to sophisticated emergent computational strategies. These strategies can be analyzed using a \"computational mechanics\" framework in which \"particles\" carry information and interactions between particles effects information processing.

From this point of view, this form of learning is closely related to classical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines and regularization theory. This paper considers the problems of an exact representation and, in more detail, of the approximation of linear and nonlinear mappings in terms of simpler functions of fewer variables. Kolmogorov's theorem concerning the representation of functions of several variables in terms of functions of one variable turns out to be almost irrelevant in the context of networks for learning. We develop a theoretical framework for approximation based on regularization techniques that leads to a class of three-layer networks that we call Generalized Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), since they are mathematically related to the well-known Radial Basis Functions, mainly used for strict interpolation tasks. GRBF networks are not only equivalent to generalized splines, but are also closely related to pattern recognition methods such as Parzen windows and potential functions and to several neural network algorithms, such as Kanerva's associative memory, backpropagation and Kohonen's topology preserving map. They also have an interesting interpretation in terms of prototypes that are synthesized and optimally combined during the learning stage.

Unlike the methods presented in chapter 3, it is not necessary to try several regularisation levels and perform as many optimisations.

Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods.

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n Profile-driven instruction level parallel scheduling with application to super blocks. : Code scheduling to exploit instruction level parallelism (ILP) is a critical problem in compiler optimization research, in light of the increased use of long-instruction-word machines. Unfortunately, optimum scheduling is com-putationally intractable, and one must resort to carefully crafted heuristics in practice. If the scope of application of a scheduling heuristic is limited to basic blocks, considerable performance loss may be incurred at block boundaries. To overcome this obstacle, basic blocks can be coalesced across branches to form larger regions such as super blocks. In the literature, these regions are typically scheduled using algorithms that are either oblivious to profile information (under the assumption that the process of forming the region has fully utilized the profile information), or use the profile information as an addendum to classical scheduling techniques. We believe that even for the simple case of linear code regions such as super blocks, additional performance improvement can be gained by utilizing the profile information in scheduling as well. We propose a general paradigm for converting any profile-insensitive list sched-uler to a profile-sensitive scheduler. Our technique is developed via a theoretical analysis of a simplified abstract model of the general problem of profile-driven scheduling over any acyclic code region, yielding a scoring measure for ranking branch instructions. The ranking digests the profile information and has the useful property that scheduling with respect to rank is provably good for minimizing the expected completion time of the region, within the limits of the abstraction. While the ranking scheme is computation-ally intractable in the most general case, it is practicable for super blocks and suggests the heuristic that we present in this paper for profile-driven scheduling of super blocks. Experiments show that our heuristic offers substantial performance improvement over prior methods on a range of integer benchmarks and several machine models.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Specifically, graphical decision-modeling formalisms|belief networks, influence diagrams, and their variants|provide compact representation of probabilistic relationships, and support inference algorithms that automatically exploit the dependence structure in such models [1, 3, 4]. These advances have brought on a resurgence of interest in computational decision systems based on normative theories of belief and preference. However, graphical decision-modeling languages are still quite limited for purposes of knowledge representation because, while they can describe the relationships among particular event instances, they cannot capture general knowledge about probabilistic relationships across classes of events. The inability to capture general knowledge is a serious impediment for those AI tasks in which the relevant factors of a decision problem cannot be enumerated in advance. A graphical decision model encodes a particular set of probabilistic dependencies, a predefined set of decision alternatives, and a specific mathematical form for a utility function. Given a properly specified model, there exist relatively efficient algorithms for calculating posterior probabilities and optimal decision policies. A range of similar cases may be handled by parametric variations of the original model. However, if the structure of dependencies, the set of available alternatives, or the form of utility function changes from situation to situation, then a fixed network representation is no longer adequate. An ideal computational decision system would possess general, broad knowledge of a domain, but would have the ability to reason about the particular circumstances of any given decision problem within the domain. One obvious approach|which we call call knowledge-based model construction (KBMC)|is to generate a decision model dynamically at run-time, based on the problem description and information received thus far. Model construction consists of selection, instantiation, and assembly of causal and associational relationships from a broad knowledge base of general relationships among domain concepts. For example, suppose we wish to develop a system to recommend appropriate actions for maintaining a computer network.

Special cases of Scheiblechner's model include standard unidimensional factor analysis models in which the loadings are held constant, and the Rasch model for binary item responses.

We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances, and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity.

In order to prove our main results, we define a new complexity measure on statistical query (SQ) learning algorithms. The view of an SQ algorithm is the maximum over all queries in the algorithm, of the number of input bits on which the query depends. We show that a restricted view SQ algorithm for a class is a general sufficient condition for learnability in both the models of attribute noise and covered (or missing) attributes. We further show that since the algorithms in question are statistical, they can also simultaneously tolerate classification noise. Classes for which these results hold, and can therefore be learned with simultaneous attribute noise and classification noise, include k-DNF, k-term-DNF by DNF representations, conjunctions with few relevant variables, and over the uniform distribution, decision lists. These noise models are the first PAC models in which all training data, attributes and labels, may be corrupted by a random process. Previous researchers had shown that the class of k-DNF is learnable with attribute noise if the attribute noise rate is known exactly. We show that all of our attribute noise learnabil-ity results, either with or without classification noise, also hold when the exact noise rate is not known, provided that the learner instead has a polynomially good approximation of the noise rate. In addition, we show that the results also hold when there is not just one noise rate, but a distinct noise rate for each attribute. Our results for learning with random covering do not require the learner to be told even an approximation of the covering rate and in addition hold in the setting with distinct covering rates for each attribute.

Such on-line disambiguation happens automatically and appears to be based on dynamically combining the strengths of association between the keywords and the two senses. Subsymbolic neural networks are very good at modeling such behavior. They learn word meanings as soft constraints on interpretation, and dynamically combine these constraints to form the most likely interpretation. On the other hand, it is very difficult to show how systematic language structures such as relative clauses could be processed in such a system. The network would only learn to associate them to specific contexts and would not be able to process new combinations of them. A closer look at understanding embedded clauses shows that humans are not very systematic in processing grammatical structures either. For example, \"The girl who the boy who the girl who lived next door blamed hit cried\" is very difficult to understand, whereas \"The car that the man who the dog that had rabies bit drives is in the garage\" is not. This difference emerges from the same semantic constraints that are at work in the disambiguation task. In this chapter we will show how the subsymbolic parser can be combined with high-level control that allows the system to process novel combinations of relative clauses systematically, while still being sensitive to the semantic constraints.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n Emergent control and planning in an autonomous vehicle. : We use a connectionist network trained with reinforcement to control both an autonomous robot vehicle and a simulated robot. We show that given appropriate sensory data and architectural structure, a network can learn to control the robot for a simple navigation problem. We then investigate a more complex goal-based problem and examine the plan-like behavior that emerges. An autonomous agent can be abstractly defined as a mapping from a sequence of sensory inputs to an appropriate action in response to these percepts. Such an agent is autonomous to the extent that its behavior is determined by its immediate inputs and past experience, rather than by its built-in control (Russell & Wefald, 1991). We are interested in investigating the cognitive capabilities of autonomous agents. We believe that cognitive behavior can emerge from the reactive, situated activity of autonomous agents. Some consensus exists about how to design autonomous agents. There should be a relatively direct coupling between perception and action, control should be distributed and decentralized, and most importantly, there should be a dynamic interaction between the environment and the agent (Maes, 1990). However, no such consensus exists on the best method to implement these design features. Connectionist networks can easily accommodate all these design features and we believe they can be effective mechanisms for controlling autonomous agents. This paper focuses on exploring connectionist designs for controlling simple navigation in an autonomous vehicle. We conclude by applying the successful design features to a more difficult problem and examine the plan-like behavior that emerges. We examine these implementation questions by testing network controllers for both a real and simulated robot in a very simple environment, using as experimental variables both type of sensory data, type of training subtasks, and amount of memory. To train the network controllers, we use a reinforcement learning algorithm which converts abstract measures of goodness (reward and punishment) into specific teacher signals. The environment, called the \"playpen\", is a rectangular box (2 fi 4 feet) with a light in one corner. The reinforcement training problems we investigate involve coordination of motor activity with the information being supplied by the sensors. The navigation problem, which we refer to as avoid and move, reinforces the robot for moving in the playpen while avoiding the walls. The more difficult problem, light as food, adds a goal state in order to simulate hunger, and reinforces the robot for periodically seeking and avoiding the light while still avoiding the walls and moving. By holding a problem constant and varying sensory ability we can determine to what extent the addition of more sensors helps the robot succeed at its problem. Similarly, we can evaluate the utility of contextual memory and different training subtasks such as auto-association and prediction. Our robot, called carbot, is a modified toy car (6 fi 9 inches) controlled by a programmable mini-board (designed by (Martin, 1992)). Carbot was inexpensive to build, primarily because it makes use of primitive sensors|no lasers, video, or sonar. It has two servomotors; one controls forward and backward motion and the other steering. The robot has two types of physical sensors: digital touch sensors on the front and back bumpers, and analog light sensors on stalks near the back. The light sensors are directed 30 degrees to each side of carbot. Carbot is controlled by a remote connectionist network that communicates with the mini-board. The network gathers input data from the sensors and determines how to set the motors for the next time step. Figure 1 shows the standard network used in our experiments. There are four discrete sets of input units; three are for sensors and one is for context memory. The first set represents the previous state of the two motors| two units per motor. The first motor unit represents the spin direction of the rear motor (this determines direction of motion|forward or backward). The second unit designates the state of the motor as on or off. The third unit represents the spin direction of the front motor (this determines the direction of turning|left or right). Note that in order to turn carbot must have both motors\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The graph for the simple domain crosses the 0 line earlier than the complex domain.

As we relax the optimality requirement more s i g n i f i c a n t l y ( w i t h a W = 0.8), macro usage in the more complex domain becomes more advantageous. The purpose of the research described in this paper is to identify the parameters that effects deductive learning and to perform experiments systematically in order to understand the nature of those effects. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology of performing parametric experimental study of deductive learning. The example here include the study of two parameters: the point on the satisficing-optimizing scale that is used during the search carried out during problem solving time and during learning time. We showed that A*, which looks for optimal solutions, cannot benefit from macro learning but as the strategy comes closer to best-first (satisficing search), the utility of macros increases. We also demonstrated that deductive learners that learn offline by solving training problems are sensitive to the type of search used during the learning. We showed that in general optimizing search is best for learning. It generates macros that increase the quality solutions regardless of the search method used during problem solving. It also improves the efficiency for problem solvers that require a high level of optimality. The only drawback in using optimizing search is the increase in learning resources spent. We are aware of the fact that the results described here are not very surprising. The goal of the parametric study is not necessarily to find exciting results, but to obtain results, sometimes even previously known, in a controlled experimental environment. The work described here is only part of our research plan. We are currently in the process of extensive experimentation with all the parameters described here and also with others. We also intend to test the validity of the conclusions reached during the study by repeating some of the tests in several of the commonly known search problems.

Our main result is that a hypothesis clause H can be derived from an example E under a background theory B with inverse entailment iff H subsumes E relative to B in Plotkin's sense. The theory B can be any clausal theory, and the example E can be any clause which is neither a tautology nor implied by B. The derived hypothesis H is a clause which is not always definite. In order to prove the result we give declarative semantics for arbitrary consistent clausal theories, and show that SB-resolution, which was originally introduced by Plotkin, is complete procedural semantics. The completeness is shown as an extension of the completeness theorem of SLD-resolution. We also show that every hypothesis H derived with saturant generalization, proposed by Rouveirol, must subsume E w.r.t. B in Buntine's sense. Moreover we show that saturant generalization can be obtained from inverse entailment by giving some restriction to its usage.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Pharmaceutical research laboratories developing test compounds for screening synthesize many related candidate compounds by linking together collections of basic molecular building blocks, known as monomers. These compounds are tested for biological activity, feeding in to screening for further analysis and drug design. The tests also provide data relating compound activity to chemical properties and aspects of the structure of associated monomers, and our focus here is studying such relationships as an aid to future monomer selection. The level of chemical activity of compounds is based on the geometry of chemical binding of test compounds to target binding sites on receptor compounds, but the screening tests are unable to identify binding configurations. Hence potentially critical covari-ate information is missing as a natural latent variable. Resulting statistical models are then mixed with respect to such missing information, so complicating data analysis and inference. This paper reports on a study of a two-monomer, two-binding site framework and associated data. We build structured mixture models that mix linear regression models, predicting chemical effectiveness, with respect to site-binding selection mechanisms. We discuss aspects of modeling and analysis, including problems and pitfalls, and describe results of analyses of a simulated and real data set. In modeling real data, we are led into critical model extensions that introduce hierarchical random effects components to adequately capture heterogeneities in both the site binding mechanisms and in the resulting levels of effectiveness of compounds once bound.

In more detail, we can associate a given default theory with a set of related credulous theories R = fR i g, where each R i uses its own total ordering of the defaults to determine which single answer to return for each query. Our goal is to select the credulous theory that has the highest \"expected accuracy\", where each R i 's expected accuracy is the probability that the answer it produces to a query will correspond correctly to the world.

Australian Journal of Intelligent Information Processing Systems, : Co-evolutionary learning, which involves the embedding of adaptive learning agents in a fitness environment which dynamically responds to their progress, is a potential solution for many technological chicken and egg problems, and is at the heart of several recent and surprising successes, such as Sim's artificial robot and Tesauro's backgammon player. We recently solved the two spirals problem, a difficult neural network benchmark classification problem, using the genetic programming primitives set up by [Koza, 1992]. Instead of using absolute fitness, we use a relative fitness [Angeline & Pollack, 1993] based on a competition for coverage of the data set. As the population reproduces, the fitness function driving the selection changes, and subproblem niches are opened, rather than crowded out. The solutions found by our method have a symbiotic structure which suggests that by holding niches open, crossover is better able to discover modular build ing blocks.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

By taking two different applications and employing many techniques, we report here a two-dimensional study whereby a domain-independent assessment of these learning methods can be possible. We consider a feed-forward network with one hidden layer. As examples of the local methods, we use kernel estimators like k-nearest neighbor (k-nn), Parzen windows, generalized k-nn, and Grow and Learn (Condensed Nearest Neighbor). We have also considered fuzzy k-nn due to its similarity. As distributed networks, we use linear perceptron, pairwise separating linear perceptron, and multilayer perceptrons with sigmoidal hidden units. We also tested the radial-basis function network which is a combination of local and distributed networks. Four criteria are taken for comparison: Correct classification of the test set, network size, learning time, and the operational complexity. We found that perceptrons when the architecture is suitable, generalize better than local, memory-based kernel estimators but require longer training and more precise computation. Local networks are simple, learn very quickly and acceptably, but use more memory.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n Storing and indexing plan derivations through explanation-based analysis of retrieval failures. : Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner dersnlp+ebl. der-snlp+ebl extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n Learning factorial codes by predictability minimization. : I propose a novel general principle for unsupervised learning of distributed non-redundant internal representations of input patterns. The principle is based on two opposing forces. For each representational unit there is an adaptive predictor which tries to predict the unit from the remaining units. In turn, each unit tries to react to the environment such that it minimizes its predictability. This encourages each unit to filter `abstract concepts' out of the environmental input such that these concepts are statistically independent of those upon which the other units focus. I discuss various simple yet potentially powerful implementations of the principle which aim at finding binary factorial codes (Bar-low et al., 1989), i.e. codes where the probability of the occurrence of a particular input is simply the product of the probabilities of the corresponding code symbols. Such codes are potentially relevant for (1) segmentation tasks, (2) speeding up supervised learning, (3) novelty detection. Methods for finding factorial codes automatically implement Occam's razor for finding codes using a minimal number of units. Unlike previous methods the novel principle has a potential for removing not only linear but also non-linear output redundancy. Illustrative experiments show that algorithms based on the principle of predictability minimization are practically feasible. The final part of this paper describes an entirely local algorithm that has a potential for learning unique representations of extended input sequences.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Most common Machine Learning approaches for selecting a good subset of relevant features rely on cross-validation. As an alternative, we present the application of a particular Minimum Description Length (MDL) measure to the task of feature subset selection. Using the MDL principle allows taking into account all of the available data at once. The new measure is information-theoretically plausible and yet still simple and therefore efficiently computable. We show empirically that this new method for judging the value of feature subsets is more efficient than and performs at least as well as methods based on cross-validation. Domains with both a large number of training examples and a large number of possible features yield the biggest gains in efficiency.

We describe and evaluate a GA-based system called GABIL that continually learns and refines concept classification rules from its interaction with the environment. The use of GAs is motivated by recent studies showing the effects of various forms of bias built into different concept learning systems, resulting in systems that perform well on certain concept classes (generally, those well matched to the biases) and poorly on others. By incorporating a GA as the underlying adaptive search mechanism, we are able to construct a concept learning system that has a simple, unified architecture with several important features. First, the system is surprisingly robust even with minimal bias. Second, the system can be easily extended to incorporate traditional forms of bias found in other concept learning systems. Finally, the architecture of the system encourages explicit representation of such biases and, as a result, provides for an important additional feature: the ability to dynamically adjust system bias. The viability of this approach is illustrated by comparing the performance of GABIL with that of four other more traditional concept learners (AQ14, C4.5, ID5R, and IACL) on a variety of target concepts.

The algorithms we use are variants and extensions of on-line gradient descent.

In fact, the bounds proved on the total prediction loss are typically expressed as a function of the total loss of the best fixed linear predictor with bounded norm.

In particular, recent advances in process optimization now allow data reconciliation of dynamic systems and appropriate problem formulations need to be considered for them. Data errors due to either miscalibrated or faulty sensors or just random events nonrepresentative of the underlying statistical distribution, can induce heavy biases in the parameter estimates and in the reconciled data. In this paper we concentrate on robust estimators and exploratory statistical methods which allow us to detect the gross errors as the data reconciliation is performed. These robust methods have the property of being insensitive to departures from ideal statistical distributions and therefore are insensitive to the presence of outliers. Once the regression is done, the outliers can be detected readily by using exploratory statistical techniques. An important feature for performance of the optimization algorithm and uniqueness of the reconciled data is the ability to classify the variables according to their observability and redundancy properties. Here an observable variable is an unmeasured quantity which can be estimated from the measured variables through the physical model while a nonredundant variable is a measured variable which cannot be estimated other than through its measurements.

In order to achieve this goal, in this paper i) we identify and detail the conceptual elements defining a parametric design task specification; ii) we illustrate how these elements are interpreted and operationalised during the design process; and iii) we formulate a generic model of parametric design problem solving. We then redescribe a number of problem solving methods in terms of the proposed generic model and we show that such a redescription enables us to provide a more precise account of the different competence behaviours expressed by the methods in Design is about constructing artifacts. This means that, broadly speaking, any design process is 'creative', in the sense that a design process produces a 'new solution', as opposed to selecting a solution from a predefined set. While recognizing the essential creative elements present in any design process, researchers, e.g. Gero (1990), restrict the use of the term 'creative design' to those design applications where the design elements of the target artifact cannot be selected from a predefined set. For instance, when designing a new car model it is normally the case that some design innovations are included, which were not present in previous car designs. In other words it is not (always) possible to characterise the process of designing a new car as one in which components are assembled and configured from a predefined set. Nevertheless, in a large number of real-world applications it is possible to assume that the target artifact is going to be designed in terms of predefined design elements. In such a scenario the design process consists of assembling and configuring these preexisting design elements in a way which satisfies the design requirements and constraints, and approximates some, typically cost-related, optimization criterion. This class of design tasks takes the name of configuration design (Stefik, 1995). In many cases, typically when the problem in hand does not exhibit complex spatial requirements and all possible solutions adhere to a common solution template, it is possible to simplify the configuration design problem even further, by modelling the target artifact as a set of parameters and characterizing design problem solving as the process of assigning values to parameters in accordance with the given design requirements, constraints, and optimization criterion. When this assumption is true for a particular task, we say that this is a parametric design task. The VT application (Marcus et al., 1988; Yost and Rothenfluh, 1996) provides a well-known example of a parametric design task. The aim of this paper is to understand what is involved in parametric design problem solving. In order to achieve this goal, in this paper i) we identify and detail the conceptual elements defining a parametric design task specification; ii) we illustrate how these elements are interpreted and operationalised during the design process; and iii) we produce a generic model of parametric design problem solving, characterised at the knowledge level, which generalizes from existing methods for parametric design.

On Learning Decision Structures. : A decision structure is an acyclic graph that specifies an order of tests to be applied to an object (or a situation) to arrive at a decision about that object. and serves as a simple and powerful tool for organizing a decision process. This paper proposes a methodology for learning decision structures that are oriented toward specific decision making situations. The methodology consists of two phases: 1determining and storing declarative rules describing the decision process, 2deriving online a decision structure from the rules. The first step is performed by an expert or by an AQ-based inductive learning program that learns decision rules from examples of decisions (AQ15 or AQ17). The second step transforms the decision rules to a decision structure that is most suitable for the given decision making situation. The system, AQDT-2, implementing the second step, has been applied to a problem in construction engineering. In the experiments, AQDT-2 outperformed all other programs applied to the same problem in terms of the accuracy and the simplicity of the generated decision structures.

Abstract In this paper we explore the use of finite mixture models for building decision support systems capable of sound probabilistic inference. Finite mixture models have many appealing properties: they are computationally efficient in the prediction (reasoning) phase, they are universal in the sense that they can approximate any problem domain distribution, and they can handle multimod-ality well. We present a formulation of the model construction problem in the Bayesian framework for finite mixture models, and describe how Bayesian inference is performed given such a model. The model construction problem can be seen as missing data estimation and we describe a realization of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for finding good models. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we report crossvalidated empirical results on several publicly available classification problem datasets, and compare our results to corresponding results obtained by alternative techniques, such as neural networks and decision trees. The comparison is based on the best results reported in the literature on the datasets in question. It appears that using the theoretically sound Bayesian framework suggested here the other reported results can be outperformed with a relatively small effort.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In L. : When dealing with the classification problems, current ILP systems often lag behind state-of-the-art attributional learners. Part of the blame can be ascribed to a much larger hypothesis space which, therefore, cannot be as thoroughly explored. However, sometimes it is due to the fact that ILP systems do not take into account the probabilistic aspects of hypotheses when classifying unseen examples. This paper proposes just that. We developed a naive Bayesian classifier within our ILP-R first order learner. The learner itself uses a clever RELIEF based heuristic which is able to detect strong dependencies within the literal space when such dependencies exist. We conducted a series of experiments on artificial and real-world data sets. The results show that the combination of ILP-R together with the naive Bayesian classifier sometimes significantly improves the classification of unseen instances as measured by both classification accuracy and average information score.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The method uses best-first search and cross-validation to wrap around the basic induction algorithm: the search explores the space of parameter values, running the basic algorithm many times on training and holdout sets produced by cross-validation to get an estimate of the expected error of each parameter setting. Thus, the final selected parameter settings are tuned for the specific induction algorithm and dataset being studied. We report experiments with this method on 33 datasets selected from the UCI and StatLog collections using C4.5 as the basic induction algorithm.

However, as transformations that improve performance on one set of problems can degrade performance on other sets, the new PE 0 is not always better than the original PE; this depends on the distribution of problems. We therefore seek the performance element whose expected performance, over this distribution, is optimal. Unfortunately, the actual distribution, which is needed to determine which element is optimal, is usually not known. Moreover, the task of finding the optimal element, even knowing the distribution, is intractable for most interesting spaces of elements. This paper presents a method, palo, that side-steps these problems by using a set of samples to estimate the unknown distribution, and by using a set of transformations to hill-climb to a local optimum. This process is based on a mathematically rigorous form of utility analysis: in particular, it uses statistical techniques to determine whether the result of a proposed transformation will be better than the original system. We also present an efficient way of implementing this learning system in the context of a general class of performance elements, and include empirical evidence that this approach can work effectively. fl Much of this work was performed at the University of Toronto, where it was supported by the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems and by an operating grant from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

In this framework, empirical volatilities (the squared relative returns of prices) exhibit a significant amount of observational noise. To model and predict their time evolution adequately, we estimate state space models that explicitly include observational noise. We obtain relaxation times for shocks in the logarithm of volatility ranging from three weeks (for foreign exchange) to three to five months (for stock indices). In most cases, a two-dimensional hidden state is required to yield residuals that are consistent with white noise. We compare these results with ordinary autoregressive models (without a hidden state) and find that autoregressive models underestimate the relaxation times by about two orders of magnitude due to their ignoring the distinction between observational and dynamic noise. This new interpretation of the dynamics of volatility in terms of relaxators in a state space model carries over to stochastic volatility models and to GARCH models, and is useful for several problems in finance, including risk management and the pricing of derivative securities.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Q-learning and classifier systems (CS) are two methods among the most used to solve reinforcement learning problems. Notwithstanding their popularity and their shared goal, they have been in the past often considered as two different models. In this paper we first show that the classifier system, when restricted to a sharp simplification called discounted max very simple classifier system (D MAX - VSCS), boils down to tabular Q-learning. It follows that D MAX -VSCS converges to the optimal policy as proved by Watkins & Dayan (1992), and that it can draw profit from the results of experimental and theoretical works dedicated to improve Q-learning and to facilitate its use in concrete applications. In the second part of the paper, we show that three of the restrictions we need to impose to the CS for deriving its equivalence with Q-learning, that is, no internal states, no don't care symbols, and no structural changes, turn out so essential as to be recently rediscovered and reprogrammed by Q-learning adepts. Eventually, we sketch further similarities among ongoing work within both research contexts. The main contribution of the paper is therefore to make explicit the strong similarities existing between Q-learning and classifier systems, and to show that experience gained with research within one domain can be useful to direct future research in the other one.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Using Matrix Back Prop, we achieve an asymptotically optimal performance on T0 (about 0.8 GOPS) for both forward and backward phases, which is not possible with the standard on-line method. Since high efficiency is futile if convergence is poor (due to the use of fixed point arithmetic), we use a mixture of fixed and floating point operations. The key observation is that the precision of fixed point is sufficient for good convergence, if the range is appropriately chosen. Though the most expensive computations are implemented in fixed point, we achieve a rate of convergence that is comparable to the floating point version.

An area of service management which has extremely high visibility and negative impact when managed badly is that of problem handling. Problem handling is a very knowledge intensive activity, particularly nowadays with the increase in number and complexity of services becoming available. Trials at several BT support centres have already demonstrated the potential of case-based reasoning technology in improving current practice for problem detection and diagnosis.

First, co-evolution works to produce good pursuers and good evaders through a pure bootstrapping process, but both types are rather specially adapted to their opponents' current counter-strategies. Second, eyes and brains can also co-evolve within each simulated species for example, pursuers usually evolved eyes on the front of their bodies (like cheetahs), while evaders usually evolved eyes pointing sideways or even backwards (like gazelles). Third, both kinds of coevolution are promoted by allowing spatially distributed populations, gene duplication, and an explicitly spatial morphogenesis program for eyes and brains that allows bilateral symmetry. The paper concludes by discussing some possible applications of simulated pursuit-evasion coevolu tion in biology and entertainment.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

(4720 Abstract The theory behind the success of adaptive reweighting and combining algorithms (arcing) such as Adaboost (Freund and Schapire [1995].[1996]) and others in reducing generalization error has not been well understood. By formulating prediction, both classification and regression, as a game where one player makes a selection from instances in the training set and the other a convex linear combination of predictors from a finite set, existing arcing algorithms are shown to be algorithms for finding good game strategies. An optimal game strategy finds a combined predictor that minimizes the maximum of the error over the training set. A bound on the generalization error for the combined predictors in terms of their maximum error is proven that is sharper than bounds to date. Arcing algorithms are described that converge to the optimal strategy. Schapire et.al. [1997] offered an explanation of why Adaboost works in terms of its ability to reduce the margin. Comparing Adaboost to our optimal arcing algorithm shows that their explanation is not valid and that the answer lies elsewhere. In this situation the VC-type bounds are misleading. Some empirical results are given to explore the situation.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In the case of artificial neural networks, learning by iterative adjustment of synaptic weights can only succeed if the network designer predefines an appropriate network structure, i.e., number of hidden layers, units, and the size and shape of their receptive and projective fields. This paper advocates the view that the network structure should not, as usually done, be determined by trial-and-error but should be computed by the learning algorithm. Incremental learning algorithms can modify the network structure by addition and/or removal of units and/or links. A survey of current connectionist literature is given on this line of thought. \"Grow and Learn\" (GAL) is a new algorithm that learns an association at one-shot due to being incremental and using a local representation. During the so-called \"sleep\" phase, units that were previously stored but which are no longer necessary due to recent modifications are removed to minimize network complexity. The incrementally constructed network can later be finetuned off-line to improve performance. Another method proposed that greatly increases recognition accuracy is to train a number of networks and vote over their responses. The algorithm and its variants are tested on recognition of handwritten numerals and seem promising especially in terms of learning speed. This makes the algorithm attractive for on-line learning tasks, e.g., in robotics. The biological plausibility of incremental learning is also discussed briefly.

These results are representation independent, in that they hold regardless of the syntactic form in which the learner chooses to represent its hypotheses. Our methods reduce the problems of cracking a number of well-known public-key cryptosys- tems to the learning problems. We prove that a polynomial-time learning algorithm for Boolean formulae, deterministic finite automata or constant-depth threshold circuits would have dramatic consequences for cryptography and number theory: in particular, such an algorithm could be used to break the RSA cryptosystem, factor Blum integers (composite numbers equivalent to 3 modulo 4), and detect quadratic residues. The results hold even if the learning algorithm is only required to obtain a slight advantage in prediction over random guessing. The techniques used demonstrate an interesting duality between learning and cryptography.

Learning Evolving Concepts Using Partial Memory Approach. : This paper addresses the problem of learning evolving concepts, that is, concepts whose meaning gradually evolves in time. Solving this problem is important to many applications, for example, building intelligent agents for helping users in Internet search, active vision, automatically updating knowledge-bases, or acquiring profiles of users of telecommunication networks. Requirements for a learning architecture supporting such applications include the ability to incrementally modify concept definitions to accommodate new information, fast learning and recognition rates, low memory needs, and the understandability of computer-created concept descriptions. To address these requirements, we propose a learning architecture based on Variable-Valued Logic, the Star Methodology, and the AQ algorithm. The method uses a partial-memory approach, which means that in each step of learning, the system remembers the current concept descriptions and specially selected representative examples from the past experience. The developed method has been experimentally applied to the problem of computer system intrusion detection. The results show significant advantages of the method in learning speed and memory requirements with only slight decreases in predictive accuracy and concept simplicity when compared to traditional batch-style learning in which all training examples are provided at once.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

With different option settings, it can construct four different types of new attribute, but all other factors are fixed.

In addition, the study demonstrates that the stronger representation power of Mof-N than conjunction and disjunction and the stronger representation power of Xof-N than these three types of new attribute can be reflected in the performance of decision tree learning in terms of higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as or, sum or max, on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Product units also have a higher information capacity than sigmoidal networks. However, this activation function has not received much attention in the literature. A possible reason for this is that one encounters some problems when using standard backpropagation to train networks containing these units. This report examines these problems, and evaluates the performance of three training algorithms on networks of this type. Empirical results indicate that the error surface of networks containing product units have more local minima than corresponding networks with summation units. For this reason, a combination of local and global training algorithms were found to provide the most reliable convergence. We then investigate how `hints' can be added to the training algorithm. By extracting a common frequency from the input weights, and training this frequency separately, we show that convergence can be accelerated. In order to compare their performance with other transfer functions, product units were implemented as candidate units in the Cascade Correlation (CC) [13] system. Using these candidate units resulted in smaller networks which trained faster than when the any of the standard (three sigmoidal types and one Gaussian) transfer functions were used. This superiority was confirmed when a pool of candidate units of four different nonlinear activation functions were used, which have to compete for addition to the network. Extensive simulations showed that for the problem of implementing random Boolean logic functions, product units are always chosen above any of the other transfer functions.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

[{"model": "gpt-4o", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Paper: \n Addressing the Selective Superiority Problem: Automatic Algorithm/Model Class Selection. : COINS Technical Report 92-30 February 1992 Abstract The problem of how to learn from examples has been studied throughout the history of machine learning, and many successful learning algorithms have been developed. A problem that has received less attention is how to select which algorithm to use for a given learning task. The ability of a chosen algorithm to induce a good generalization depends on how appropriate the model class underlying the algorithm is for the given task. We define an algorithm's model class to be the representation language it uses to express a generalization of the examples. Supervised learning algorithms differ in their underlying model class and in how they search for a good generalization. Given this characterization, it is not surprising that some algorithms find better generalizations for some, but not all tasks. Therefore, in order to find the best generalization for each task, an automated learning system must search for the appropriate model class in addition to searching for the best generalization within the chosen class. This thesis proposal investigates the issues involved in automating the selection of the appropriate model class. The presented approach has two facets. Firstly, the approach combines different model classes in the form of a model combination decision tree, which allows the best representation to be found for each subconcept of the learning task. Secondly, which model class is the most appropriate is determined dynamically using a set of heuristic rules. Explicit in each rule are the conditions in which a particular model class is appropriate and if it is not, what should be done next. In addition to describing the approach, this proposal describes how the approach will be evaluated in order to demonstrate that it is both an efficient and effective method for automatic model selection.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The updating process of the Boltzmann machine approximates a Gibbs sampling process of the original Bayesian network in the sense that the Boltzmann machine converges to the same final state as the Gibbs sampler does.

Scatter-partitioning Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks increase their number of degrees of freedom with the complexity of an input-output mapping to be estimated on the basis of a supervised training data set. Due to its superior expressive power a scatter-partitioning Gaussian RBF (GRBF) model, termed Supervised Growing Neural Gas (SGNG), is selected from the literature. SGNG employs a one-stage error-driven learning strategy and is capable of generating and removing both hidden units and synaptic connections. A slightly modified SGNG version is tested as a function estimator when the training surface to be fitted is an image, i.e., a 2-D signal whose size is finite. The relationship between the generation, by the learning system, of disjointed maps of hidden units and the presence, in the image, of pictorially homogeneous subsets (segments) is investigated. Unfortunately, the examined SGNG version performs poorly both as function estimator and image segmenter. This may be due to an intrinsic inadequacy of the one-stage error-driven learning strategy to adjust structural parameters and output weights simultaneously but consistently. In the framework of RBF networks, further studies should investigate the combination of two-stage error-driven learning strategies with synapse generation and removal criteria. y Internal report of the paper entitled \"Image segmentation with scatter-partitioning RBF networks: A feasibility study,\" to be presented at the conference Applications and Science of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Evolutionary Computation, part of SPIE's International Symposium on Optical Science, Engineering and Instrumentation, 19-24 July 1998, San Diego, CA.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Chiarulli, On-Line Prediction of Multiprocessor Memory Access Patterns, : Technical Report UMIACS-TR-96-59 and CS-TR-3676 Institute for Advanced Computer Studies University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 Abstract Shared memory multiprocessors require reconfigurable interconnection networks (INs) for scalability. These INs are reconfigured by an IN control unit. However, these INs are often plagued by undesirable reconfiguration time that is primarily due to control latency, the amount of time delay that the control unit takes to decide on a desired new IN configuration. To reduce control latency, a trainable prediction unit (PU) was devised and added to the IN controller. The PUs job is to anticipate and reduce control configuration time, the major component of the control latency. Three different on-line prediction techniques were tested to learn and predict repetitive memory access patterns for three typical parallel processing applications, the 2-D relaxation algorithm, matrix multiply and Fast Fourier Transform. The predictions were then used by a routing control algorithm to reduce control latency by configuring the IN to provide needed memory access paths before they were requested. Three prediction techniques were used and tested: 1). a Markov predictor, 2). a linear predictor and 3). a time delay neural network (TDNN) predictor. As expected, different predictors performed best on different applications, however, the TDNN produced the best overall results.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

In Maher, M.L. & Pu, : In the late 1980s, we developed one of the early case-based design systems called Kritik. Kritik autonomously generated preliminary (conceptual, qualitative) designs for physical devices by retrieving and adapting past designs stored in its case memory. Each case in the system had an associated structure-behavior-function (SBF) device model that explained how the structure of the device accomplished its functions. These casespecific device models guided the process of modifying a past design to meet the functional specification of a new design problem. The device models also enabled verification of the design modifications. Kritik2 is a new and more complete implementation of Kritik. In this paper, we take a retrospective view on Kritik. In early papers, we had described Kritik as integrating case-based and model-based reasoning. In this integration, Kritik also grounds the computational process of case-based reasoning in the SBF content theory of device comprehension. The SBF models not only provide methods for many specific tasks in case-based design such as design adaptation and verification, but they also provide the vocabulary for the whole process of case-based design, from retrieval of old cases to storage of new ones. This grounding, we believe, is essential for building well-constrained theories of case-based design.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Most research in explanation-based learning involves relaxing constraints on the variables in the explanation of a specific example, rather than generalizing the graphical structure of the explanation itself. However, this precludes the acquisition of concepts where an iterative or recursive process is implicitly represented in the explanation by a fixed number of applications. This paper presents an algorithm that generalizes explanation structures and reports empirical results that demonstrate the value of acquiring recursive and iterative concepts. The BAGGER2 algorithm learns recursive and iterative concepts, integrates results from multiple examples, and extracts useful subconcepts during generalization. On problems where learning a recursive rule is not appropriate, the system produces the same result as standard explanation-based methods. Applying the learned recursive rules only requires a minor extension to a PROLOG-like problem solver, namely, the ability to explicitly call a specific rule. Empirical studies demonstrate that generalizing the structure of explanations helps avoid the recently reported negative effects of learning.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The student modeling component of the ATS, ML-Modeler, uses machine learning (ML) techniques to emulate the students novice-to-expert transition. ML-Modeler infers which learning methods the student has used to reach the current knowledge state by comparing the students solution trace to an expert solution and generating plausible hypotheses about what misconceptions and errors the student has made. A case-based approach is used to generate hypotheses through incorrectly applying analogy, overgeneralization, and overspecialization. The student and expert models use a network-based representation that includes abstract concepts and relationships as well as strategies for problem solving. Fuzzy methods are used to represent the uncertainty in the student model.

On-line robotic exploration plays a crucial role in obtaining a better policy. Optionally, this architecture can be extended with a third network: the reinforcement network. The learning controller is implemented on a CAD-based contact force simulator. In contrast with most other related work, the experiments are simulated in 3D with 6 degrees of freedom. Performance of a peg-into-hole task is measured in insertion time and average/maximum force level. The fact that a better performance can be obtained in this way, demonstrates the importance of model-free learning techniques for repetitive robotic assembly tasks. The paper presents the approach and simulation results.

Also, we view the use of the hypothesized principles for analogical design as the task of hypothesis testing, another subtask of discovery. In this paper, we focus on discovery of physical principles by generalization over design experiences in the domain of physical devices. Some important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. We represent a reasoner's comprehension of specific designs in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. An SBF model provides a functional and causal explanation of the working of a device. We represent domain principles as device-independent behavior-function (BF) models. We show that (i) the function of a device determines what to generalize from its SBF model, (ii) the SBF model itself suggests how far to generalize, and (iii) the typology of functions indicates what method to use.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The experiments for both the human subjects and neural networks make use of interpolations of facial expressions from the Pictures of Facial Affect Database [Ekman and Friesen, 1976]. The only difference in materials between those used in the human subjects experiments [Young et al., 1997] and our materials are the manner in which the interpolated images are constructed - image-quality morphs versus pixel averages. Nevertheless, the neural network accurately captures the categorical nature of the human responses, showing sharp transitions in labeling of images along the interpolated sequence. Crucially for a demonstration of categorical perception [Harnad, 1987], the model shows the highest discrimination between transition images at the crossover point. The model also captures the shape of the reaction time curves of the human subjects along the sequences. Finally, the network matches human subjects' judgements of which expressions are being mixed in the images. The main failing of the model is that there are intrusions of neutral responses in some transitions, which are not seen in the human subjects. We attribute this difference to the difference between the pixel average stimuli and the image quality morph stimuli. These results show that a simple neural network classifier, with no access to the biological constraints that are presumably imposed on the human emotion processor, and whose only access to the surrounding culture is the category labels placed by American subjects on the facial expressions, can nevertheless simulate fairly well the human responses to emotional expressions.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

One primary difficulty, however, is that the solutions may grow too big without any improvement of their generalization ability. In this paper we investigate the fundamental relationship between the performance and complexity of the evolved structures. The essence of the parsimony problem is demonstrated empirically by analyzing error landscapes of programs evolved for neural network synthesis. We consider genetic programming as a statistical inference problem and apply the Bayesian model-comparison framework to introduce a class of fitness functions with error and complexity terms. An adaptive learning method is then presented that automatically balances the model-complexity factor to evolve parsimonious programs without losing the diversity of the population needed for achieving the desired training accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown on the induction of sigma-pi neural networks for solving a real-world medical diagnosis problem as well as benchmark tasks.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Abstract A technique is described which allows unimodal function optimization methods to be extended to efficiently locate all optima of multimodal problems. We describe an algorithm based on a traditional genetic algorithm (GA). This involves iterating the GA, but uses knowledge gained during one iteration to avoid re-searching, on subsequent iterations, regions of problem space where solutions have already been found. This is achieved by applying a fitness derating function to the raw fitness function, so that fitness values are depressed in the regions of the problem space where solutions have already been found. Consequently, the likelihood of discovering a new solution on each iteration is dramatically increased. The technique may be used with various styles of GA, or with other optimization methods, such as simulated annealing. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of multimodal test functions. The technique is at least as fast as fitness sharing methods. It provides a speedup of between 1 and 10p on a problem with p optima, depending on the value of p and the convergence time complexity.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The process of coding and revising such simulators is extremely time-consuming, because they are almost always written in conventional programming languages. Scientists and engineers can therefore benefit from software that facilitates construction of programs for simulating physical systems. Our research adapts the methodology of deductive program synthesis to the problem of constructing numerical simulation codes. We have focused on simulators that can be represented as second order functional programs composed of numerical integration and root extraction routines. We have developed a system that uses first order Horn logic to synthesize numerical simulators built from these components. Our approach is based on two ideas: First, we axiomatize only the relationship between integration and differentiation. We neither attempt nor require a complete axiomatization of mathematical analysis. Second, our system uses a representation in which functions are reified as objects. Function objects are encoded as lambda expressions. Our knowledge base includes an axiomatization of term equality in the lambda calculus. It also includes axioms defining the semantics of numerical integration and root extraction routines. We use depth bounded SLD resolution to construct proofs and synthesize programs. Our system has successfully constructed numerical simulators for computational design of jet engine nozzles and sailing yachts, among others. Our results demonstrate that deductive synthesis techniques can be used to construct numerical simulation programs for realistic applications (Ellman and Murata 1998). Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to problem formulation. The choice of objective function, constraints and design parameters can dramatically impact the computational cost of optimization and the quality of the resulting design. The best formulation varies from one application to another. A design engineer will usually not know the best formulation in advance. In order to address this problem, we have developed a system that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system includes an executable, data-flow language for representing optimization strategies. The language allows an engineer to define multiple stages of optimization, each using different approximations of the objective and constraints or different abstractions of the design space. We have also developed a set of transformations that reformulate strategies represented in our language. The transformations can approximate objective and constraint functions, abstract or reparameterize search spaces, or divide an optimization process into multiple stages.

In the standard depiction of the network's state space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed points of the dynamics. I argue for a modification of this picture: if an object has a continuous family of instantiations, it should be represented by a continuous attractor. This idea is illustrated with a network that learns to complete patterns. To perform the task of filling in missing information, the network develops a continuous attractor that models the manifold from which the patterns are drawn. From a statistical viewpoint, the pattern completion task allows a formulation of unsupervised A classic approach to invariant object recognition is to use a recurrent neural network as an associative memory[1]. In spite of the intuitive appeal and biological plausibility of this approach, it has largely been abandoned in practical applications. This paper introduces two new concepts that could help resurrect it: object representation by continuous attractors, and learning attractors by pattern completion. In most models of associative memory, memories are stored as attractive fixed points at discrete locations in state space[1]. Discrete attractors may not be appropriate for patterns with continuous variability, like the images of a three-dimensional object from different viewpoints. When the instantiations of an object lie on a continuous pattern manifold, it is more appropriate to represent objects by attractive manifolds of fixed points, or continuous attractors. To make this idea practical, it is important to find methods for learning attractors from examples. A naive method is to train the network to retain examples in short-term memory. This method is deficient because it does not prevent the network from storing spurious fixed points that are unrelated to the examples.

However, complex general behavior such as evading predators or avoiding obstacles, which is not tied to specific environments, turns out to be very difficult to evolve. Often the system discovers mechanical strategies (such as moving back and forth) that help the agent cope, but are not very effective, do not appear believable and would not generalize to new environments. The problem is that a general strategy is too difficult for the evolution system to discover directly. This paper proposes an approach where such complex general behavior is learned incrementally, by starting with simpler behavior and gradually making the task more challenging and general. The task transitions are implemented through successive stages of delta-coding (i.e. evolving modifications), which allows even converged populations to adapt to the new task. The method is tested in the stochastic, dynamic task of prey capture, and compared with direct evolution. The incremental approach evolves more effective and more general behavior, and should also scale up to harder tasks.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Genetic programming (GP) is also a successful evolutionary learning technique that provides powerful parameterized primitive constructs. Unlike ANNs, though, GP does not have such a principled procedure for changing parts of the learned system based on its current performance. This paper introduces Neural Programming, a connectionist representation for evolving programs that maintains the benefits of GP. The connectionist model of Neural Programming allows for a regression credit-blame procedure in an evolutionary learning system.

The construction of a heterogeneous knowledge system that can support practical design thus raises two fundamental questions: how to accumulate huge volumes of design information, and how to support heterogeneous design processing? Fortunately, partial answers to both questions exist separately. Legacy databases already contain huge amounts of general-purpose design information. In addition, modern knowledge systems typically characterize the kinds of knowledge needed by specific problem-solving methods quite precisely. This leads us to hypothesize method-specific data-to-knowledge compilation as a potential mechanism for integrating heterogeneous knowledge systems and legacy databases for design. In this paper, first we outline a general computational architecture called HIPED for this integration. Then, we focus on the specific issue of how to convert data accessed from a legacy database into a form appropriate to the problem-solving method used in a heterogeneous knowledge system. We describe an experiment in which a legacy knowledge system called Interactive Kritik is integrated with an ORACLE database using IDI as the communication tool. The limited experiment indicates the computational feasibility of method-specific data-to-knowledge compilation, but also raises additional research issues.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

We refer to the mechanism by which an animal evaluates the fitness consequences of its actions as a \"motivation system,\" and argue that such a system must evolve along with the behaviors it evaluates. We describe simulations of the evolution of populations of agents instantiating a number of different architectures for generating action and learning, in worlds of differing complexity. We find that in some cases, members of the populations evolve motivation systems that are accurate enough to direct learning so as to increase the fitness of the actions the agents perform. Furthermore, the motivation systems tend to incorporate systematic distortions in their representations of the worlds they inhabit; these distortions can increase the adaptiveness of the behavior generated.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

This implies that a case should be indexed appropriately when stored in memory. A case-based system, being dynamic in that it stores cases for reuse, needs to learn indices for the new knowledge as the system designers cannot envision that knowledge. Irrespective of the type of indexing (structural or functional), a hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how structure-behavior-function (SBF) models help in learning structural indices to design cases in the domain of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design provides both the vocabulary for structural indexing of design cases and the inductive biases for index generalization. We further discuss how model-based learning can be integrated with similarity-based learning (that uses prior design cases) for learning the level of index generalization.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

The goal of the competition was to solve the TRAINS problems, that is to discover the simplest classification rules for train-like structured objects. The rule complexity was judged by a Prolog program that counted the number of various components in the rule expressed in the from of Prolog Horn clauses. There were 65 entries from several countries submitted to the competition. The GMU teams entry was generated by three members of the AQ family of learning programs: AQ-DT, INDUCE and AQ17-HCI. The paper analyses the results obtained by these programs and compares them to those obtained by other learning programs. It also presents ideas for further research that were inspired by the competition. One of these ideas is a challenge to the machine learning community to develop a measure of knowledge complexity that would adequately capture the cognitive complexity of knowledge. A preliminary measure of such cognitive complexity, called Ccomplexity, different from the Prolog-complexity (P-complexity) used in the competition, is briefly discussed.

The first phase is carried by the CLP and the second one by the GA. We present a specific framework where ECL i PS e (ECRC Common Logic Programming System) and GENOCOP (GEnetic algorithm for Numerical Optimization for COnstrained Problems) are integrated in a framework called CoCo (COmputational intelligence plus COnstraint logic programming). The CoCo system is applied to the training problem for neural networks. We consider constrained networks, e.g. neural networks with shared weights, constraints on the weights for example domain constraints for hardware implementation etc. Then ECL i PS e is used to generate the chromosome representation together with other constraints which ensure, in most cases, that each network is specified by exactly one chromosome. Thus the problem becomes a constrained optimization problem, where the optimization criterion is to optimize the error of the network, and GENOCOP is used to find an optimal solution.

Back, \"Function approximation with neural networks and local methods: bias, variance and smoothness\", : We review the use of global and local methods for estimating a function mapping R m ) R n from samples of the function containing noise. The relationship between the methods is examined and an empirical comparison is performed using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) global neural network model, the single nearest-neighbour model, a linear local approximation (LA) model, and the following commonly used datasets: the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, the Sunspot time series, British English Vowel data, TIMIT speech phonemes, building energy prediction data, and the sonar dataset. We find that the simple local approximation models often outperform the MLP. No criterion such as classification/prediction, size of the training set, dimensionality of the training set, etc. can be used to distinguish whether the MLP or the local approximation method will be superior. However, we find that if we consider histograms of the k-NN density estimates for the training datasets then we can choose the best performing method a priori by selecting local approximation when the spread of the density histogram is large and choosing the MLP otherwise. This result correlates with the hypothesis that the global MLP model is less appropriate when the characteristics of the function to be approximated varies throughout the input space.

Fully accepted to Research in Engineering Design, : Automatic design optimization is highly sensitive to problem formulation. The choice of objective function, constraints and design parameters can dramatically impact the computational cost of optimization and the quality of the resulting design. The best formulation varies from one application to another. A design engineer will usually not know the best formulation in advance. In order to address this problem, we have developed a system that supports interactive formulation, testing and reformulation of design optimization strategies. Our system includes an executable, data-flow language for representing optimization strategies. The language allows an engineer to define multiple stages of optimization, each using different approximations of the objective and constraints or different abstractions of the design space. We have also developed a set of transformations that reformulate strategies represented in our language. The transformations can approximate objective and constraint functions, abstract or reparameterize search spaces, or divide an optimization process into multiple stages. The system is applicable in principle to any design problem that can be expressed in terms of constrained optimization; however, we expect the system to be most useful when the design artifact is governed by algebraic and ordinary differential equations. We have tested the system on problems of racing yacht design and jet engine nozzle design. We report experimental results demonstrating that our reformulation techniques can significantly improve the performance of automatic design optimization. Our research demonstrates the viability of a reformulation methodology that combines symbolic program transformation with numerical experimentation.

Adaptation strategies differ from standard adaptation rules in that they encode general memory search procedures for finding the information needed during case adaptation; this paper focuses on the issues involved in learning memory search procedures to form the basis of new adaptation strategies. It proposes a method that starts with a small library of abstract adaptation rules and uses introspective reasoning about the system's memory organization to generate the memory search plans needed to apply those rules. The search plans are then packaged with the original abstract rules to form new adaptation strategies for future use. This process allows a CBR system not only to learn about its domain, by storing the results of case adaptation, but also to learn how to apply the cases in its memory more effectively.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

Such problems arise, for example, when an attribute assigned to some node cannot be measured, or there is a significant change in the costs of measuring attributes or in the frequency distribution of events from different decision classes. An attractive approach to resolving this problem is to learn and store knowledge in the form of decision rules, and to generate from them, whenever needed, a decision tree that is most suitable in a given situation. An additional advantage of such an approach is that it facilitates building compact decision trees , which can be much simpler than the logically equivalent conventional decision trees (by compact trees are meant decision trees that may contain branches assigned a set of values , and nodes assigned derived attributes, i.e., attributes that are logical or mathematical functions of the original ones). The paper describes an efficient method, AQDT-1, that takes decision rules generated by an AQ-type learning system (AQ15 or AQ17), and builds from them a decision tree optimizing a given optimality criterion. The method can work in two modes: the standard mode , which produces conventional decision trees, and compact mode, which produces compact decision trees. The preliminary experiments with AQDT-1 have shown that the decision trees generated by it from decision rules (conventional and compact) have outperformed those generated from examples by the well-known C4.5 program both in terms of their simplicity and their predictive accuracy.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?

An ASOCS is an adaptive network composed of many simple computing elements operating asynchronously and in parallel. This paper focuses on Adaptive Algorithm 2 (AA2) and details its architecture and learning algorithm. AA2 has significant memory and knowledge maintenance advantages over previous ASOCS models. An ASOCS can operate in either a data processing mode or a learning mode. During learning mode, the ASOCS is given a new rule expressed as a boolean conjunction. The AA2 learning algorithm incorporates the new rule in a distributed fashion in a short, bounded time. During data processing mode, the ASOCS acts as a parallel hardware circuit.\nTask: \nThere are following categories: \n[neural_networks, genetic_algorithms, theory, reinforcement_learning, probabilistic_methods]\nIs the topic of this paper in the category list?
