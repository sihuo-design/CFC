# CFC

**The official code for "Coarse-to-Fine Open-Set Graph Node Classification with Large Language Models".**

---

## Overview

CFC (Coarse-to-Fine Classification) is an open-set classification framework. It enables:

- **In-distribution (ID) classification**  
- **Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and classification**  

Unlike existing methods that treat all OOD samples as a single class, CFC can provide **probable OOD labels** for improved interpretability and practical utility in applications.
